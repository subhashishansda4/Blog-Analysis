0,37,introduction if anything kills over ten million people in the next few decades it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. not missiles but microbes. bill gates s remarks at a ted conference in two thousand fourteen right after the world had avoided the ebola outbreak. when the new unprecedented invisible virus hit us it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population. this public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities. for the past few years artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors clinical practices translational medical and biomedical research. after the first case was detected in china on december 31st two thousand nineteen it was an ai program developed by bluedot that alerted the world about the pandemic. it was quick to realise ai s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus. many tracing apps use ai to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross infection by using ai algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them. so how does ai do that ibm watson a sophisticated ai that works on cloud computing and natural language processing has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level. being a conversational ai since two thousand thirteen watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs. researchers at google inc. showed that an ai system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician level sensitivity. by identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes gene expression and protein abundance levels machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage. machine learning ml techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data which can further help in clustering patients traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes. since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age gender disease history disease specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions etc ml can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms. ml algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised. unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases. clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters. since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions such as genes principal component analysis pca creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone. supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event expected value of a disease level or expected survival time or risk of down s syndrome. biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning. in addition to this the use of ehrs and bayesian networks which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively. unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine readable structured data with the help of natural language processing nlp . nlp works with two components text processing and classification. text processing helps in identifying a series of disease relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases. chest screening through ml and nlp has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients. healthcare organizations use nlp based chatbots to increase interactions with patients keeping their mental health and wellness in check. deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non linear patterns in data using algorithms like convolution neural network recurrent neural network deep belief network and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction. when it comes to genome interpretation deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines. sepsis watch is an ai system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over thirty two million data points to create a patient s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis. another method known as the learning based optimization of the under sampling pattern loupe is based on integrating full resolution mri scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions. robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery. even after striking the right balance between human decisions and ai precision robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console. thus autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs cut tissues etc. or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood tissue or valve. researchers at children s national hospital washington have already developed an ai called smart tissue autonomous robot star which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ml powered suturing tool that automatically detects the patient s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point. cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs. through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information medications and therapies. how can it help in biomedical research since ai can analyze literature beyond readability it can be used to concise biomedical research. with the help of ml algorithms and nlp ai can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly. taking it to the next level ai systems like the computational modelling assistant cma helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind. such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein protein interaction information extraction. ai as precision medicine since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile the various ai devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently. with the help of ml complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy. deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient s emotional state food intake or health monitoring. omics refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles relationships of various branches ending with the suffix omics such as genomics proteomics etc. omics based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients. how it helps in psychology and neuro patients for psychologists studying creativity ai is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon. studies show that ai can conduct therapy sessions e therapy sessions and assessments autonomously also assisting human practitioners before during or after sessions. the detection and computational analysis of psychological signal project uses ml computer vision and nlp to analyze language physical gestures and social signals to identify cues for human distress. this ground breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support. in the future it will combine data captured during face to face interviews with information on sleeping eating and online behaviours for a complete patient view. stroke identification stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than five hundred million people worldwide. thrombus in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major about eighty five percent cause of stroke occurrence. in recent years ai techniques have been used in numerous stroke related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem. with ai at our disposal large amounts of data with rich information more complications and real life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena. currently two ml algorithms genetic fuzzy finite state machine and pca were implemented to build a model building solution. these include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage. an alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded. ml methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis. patient monitoring today the market for ai based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing. it is evolving with artificial sensors smart technologies and explores everything from brain computer interfaces to nanorobotics. companies with their smart watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not patients . an obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors glucose monitors pulse monitors oximeters and ecg monitors. with patient monitoring becoming crucial ai finds numerous applications in chronic conditions intensive care units operating rooms emergency rooms and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision making can be measured in seconds. more advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants. these play an impeccable role in patient management post surgery or rehabilitation. demographics laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest transfer into the intensive care unit or even death. in addition an interpretable machine learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery. this suggests that with deep learning algorithms raw patient monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision making. conclusion considering the vast range of tasks that an ai can do it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. using sophisticated algorithms ai can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises ethical measures training physicians to use it standard regulations etc the role of ai in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. the biggest challenge is the integration of ai in daily practice. all of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective.,introduction kills people decades highly

1,38,human minds a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration. however no matter how captivating a human mind can be it could sometimes be appalled. it could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more to go beyond and unravel the limitations or maybe something like pure greed. humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme. intelligence calls out for supremacy and so what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves artificial intelligence came as a revolution havoc when it first came to the light. the concept of making machines does work on their own like granting machines the intelligence. the idea of making machines work like humans came back in the nineteens. back then people didn t believe in such a thing as making a non living thing work think and carry tasks on its own not to mention to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills. the facts are it did. by one thousand nine hundred ninety seven. the greatest chess player garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could ve never defeated him. it was a rule of power of betterment of skills and the granted supremacy. were ai and machines just tools equipment something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision well initially it was however as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai a lot changed. human research went deeper and deeper and as a result the machines evolved with it. at present ai machines is a growing field. as it develops and improves it has become a part of the industrial revolution. in industries most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines. naturally with the evolution in machines its precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies and all the other factors made it a better choice. a choice over humans. this led to fear a fear of a not so distant future a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they ll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment. with the population increase around the world it became the new tech threat for the labor market. then again how true is it does ai really oppose a threat will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs will it lead to mass unemployment will the machines really surpass humans will the creation take over the creator no matter how fearful the future with ai may seem in reality it is not that scary. truth is ai is the present reality it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution. technology is growing. there was a time where technology was just an idea but today that idea has been implemented it s working and is carried out. nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence it s a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning. many jobs will be replaced by machines as ai evolves it ll keep challenging human minds and their skills. with the present covid nineteen situation contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks. the jobs of secretaries schedulers and book keeper are at risk too. manufacturing units agriculture food services retail transportation logistic and hospitality are all a part of the ai affected automation. at an estimation it is said that around twenty million jobs especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots. as ai robotics threed printing and genetics make their way in even the architects medical docs and music composers feel threatened by technology. making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too now that can be terrifying. however as much as machines will be replacing few jobs they ll also be creating new jobs. with the economic growth innovation and investment around one hundred thirty three million jobs are said to be generated. these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one s creativity strategy and entrepreneurial skills. so what is the catch well it s the skills. even though ai is creating three times more jobs than it is destroying it s the skills that count. ai surged in new job opportunities opportunities like senior data scientist mobile application developer and seo specialist. these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai it s born however to do these jobs or for its qualification one needs high level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time consuming task. the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations. it s the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most. therefore as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt learn equip ourselves and grow with it. the companies have to work together to build an ai ready workplace. they should collaborate with the government educators and non profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies impacts faster while also providing the employees some security. the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities. the employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring ai based skills for their day to day work. new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives. employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills. they ll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future. howsoever it s not like ai will totally take over control even though ai proves to be a better choice it still has its limitations at present. first it s expensive secondly manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment. machines are also very high maintenance therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines. underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries might take years. ai can also be risky and unethical as it s hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrong. no matter how advanced ai gets there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand i.e. soft skills. skills like teamwork communication creativity and critical thinking are something that ai hasn t been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity leadership and emotional intelligence has increased. although with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human to human interaction the humans seem to fade away a little. with this era comes the need for good leaders. leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training. leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines. the ones who are patient calm and optimized. in conclusion yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but there s nothing humans haven t overcome. adaptation and up gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival. as we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution let s buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels skills so as to not let ourselves eliminated. after all this is an unending race with infinity as the end all we could do is try not to run out of fuel. try not to be outdated.,human minds fascination carrying potential tinkering nature pixie dust intelligence creating solving mysteries wonders admiration matter captivating human mind appalled hunger

2,39,introduction ai is rapidly evolving in the employment sector particularly in matters involving business and finance. finance management economics and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally particularly at the graduate level due to their high employability. however the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that. according to research two hundred thirty jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next five years. this is due to the nature of the work as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information which machines excel at. large complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by ai powered computers than by people. algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans. in such matters involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used namely machine learning. machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence ai in systems which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience. it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs. its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps which start with the collection of data. this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure. the second and most time consuming step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data which involves the recognition of outliers trends and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible. the third step consists of formatting data which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources. step four is where ai comes into place. self service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them. the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern. lastly the data is divided into two sets one for training the algorithm and one for analysis. there are three types of machine learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning. the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning which is based on accurately labeled data. the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation. the rest of the information is referred to as input features which supervises the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants. in the case of unsupervised learning the machine isn t given labeled sets of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided. since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities this method helps with the classifying of such data. reinforcement learning comprises experience based learning. similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions. these variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following passages. machine learning in finance and banking there are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking. the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds. fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year. the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger document forgery and mortgage fraud. usually finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization. with expanding innovative headway misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information. fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters. therefore most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions. machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups. it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses like the client s record history ip address area and so forth. depending on the type of exchange taking place the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision. examples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai data visor and teradata machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading portfolio management loan underwriting chatbots and improving customer service. algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value timing and volume. an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run. in contrast to human dealers algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day. machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal. likewise algorithmic exchanging doesn t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires. the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities. in the banking industry organizations access a large number of shopper information with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process. machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people. data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records search for interesting special cases and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection. for instance the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information like age pay occupation and the buyer s credit conduct. the benefits of machine learning as with any form of revolutionary technology the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages. it s been observed that upon correct usage it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior. we ve also seen several of the largest it conglomerates such as google amazon and microsoft introduce cloud machine learning platforms. in terms of business ml can aid businesses by identifying consumer s demands and formulate a pattern based on them allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales. it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms. historical data a process visualization tool a flexible analytical environment and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture. the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor. this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks. in the financial sector machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management algorithmic trading loan underwriting and fraud detection. chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security customer support and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking. another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition which entails a system or program that recognizes objects people places and movements in photos. it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms. the downfalls of machine learning with all the benefits of its advancement machine learning isn t the most perfect thing. there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition time and resources and high errors and wrong interpretations. one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project. more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality. there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced. machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy. it also needs huge resources to work. this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work. another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations. you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results. conclusion there have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come. with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines. in countries like japan mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors. from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks everything is done by ai. however ai cannot replace humans in the future. humans have several capabilities which even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have. these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection. for example when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle. a machine s touch would not be able to soothe a child. another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do. like computers ai will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time consuming. without humans themselves there is no future for ai.,introduction rapidly evolving employment sector matters involving business finance finance management economics accounting popular university courses globally graduate level due employability

3,40,anything that could give rise to smarter than human intelligence in the form of artificial intelligence brain computer interfaces or neuroscience based human intelligence enhancement wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. nothing else is even in the same league. eliezer yudkowsky ai researcher there s no denying robots and automation are increasingly part of our daily lives. just look around the grocery store or the highway they are everywhere. this makes us wonder what if ai can replace human intelligence what can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow let us try to find the answers to all these questions and more. let s first understand what is artificial intelligence artificial intelligence or ai basically machines displaying intelligence. this can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on facebook. artificial intelligence can be further broken down into many different types. there are ais designed to do specific tasks such as detecting a specific type of cancer. however there are also ais that can do multiple tasks such as driving a car. there are many types of ais. among the top most important fields are machine learning or ml neural network computer vision and natural language processing or nlp. machine learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill. machine learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill. machine learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment. netflix uses machine learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seen. neural networks are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. these algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give. artificial neural networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancer. computer vision is the idea that computers have visions. this allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do depending on the programming camera used etc. computer vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to another. natural language processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say. an example of this is siri. siri is able to listen to our demands process what it means and provide you an answer based on what is researched. now that we know what an ai is and what it can do let s talk about the issue. ais allow for the automation of jobs thereby replacing what humans already do. this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people. this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest. in addition to social unrest ai improves over time. this means it becomes smarter faster and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do such as preparing fast food. it is predicted that ai will improve so much over fifty to one hundred years that ai will become super intelligent. this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth. according to many experts such as elon musk this could cause the end of human civilization. ai could potentially start a war against humans burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions. at that point in theory we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal. this means that we cannot unplug the machine in effect ai will replace human intelligence. but will this happen in next ten to thirty years no the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do. currently ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems. ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement. it also takes time for ai to improve. for example boston dynamics one of the world s top robotics company had a robot in two thousand nine that needed assistance to walk. fast forward to two thousand nineteen not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects do backflips and so much more. in addition to the timing it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable. for example a desktop computer costs around dollar one hundred0 in one thousand nine hundred ninety nine but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price. ai will go through the same curve. but what happens after those ten to thirty years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe. as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper. as this happens more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money increase productivity and most importantly stay competitive. as we have demonstrated ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning. the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today. it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills. however ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence ethics and creativity. this seen in three distinct example ibm ibm uses its ibm watson to program the ai to create a movie trailer. fox approached ibm and said they have a movie coming out on ai scifi horror. they asked ibm if their platform ibm watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scary sad or happy or other moments in the movie that provoked quality emotions based on how the machine was programmed to identify such emotions in a quantifiable manner. ibm watson was able to generate a trailer for the movie morgan. the result a movie trailer created by machines example google in two thousand eighteen google demonstrated an ai assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff. the ai was able to set up an appointment what was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation. the receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her. that is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology. eventually it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do making many sales jobs obsolete. example ai generated art in two thousand eighteen a paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait. it generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art. it was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars. the painting sold at an auction for four thirty five thousand us dollars. however we cannot for sure say that ai will replace human intelligence. this is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics. elon musk founded open ai a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity. in addition to this there are many factors that affect the long term outcome of ai replacing human intelligence. like to what degree will other humans allow for ai to take over depending on the field do people even want artificial intelligence to help them or will they prefer a human counterpart while we may not be able to control what happens in the long run we can definitely secure our short term future. strategic and creative thinking the ability to think outside the box is very human. there are thousands upon thousands of slightly different possible outcomes that may result from every distinguishable action that the human mind with its ability to judge from experience is programmed for these purposes in a far more sophisticated manner than ai can currently achieve. as the billionaire founder of alibaba jack ma famously said ai has logic human beings have wisdom . conflict resolution and negotiations with our understanding of the complexities of human related processes and our ability to improvise and judge we are far better equipped to deal with conflicts than robots are ever likely to be. ai may be able to recognize faces and images but it can rarely successfully read the feelings of those faces. humans to lesser or greater degrees are capable of an accurate analysis of emotional subtext. with the application of intuition and the use of delicately worded or elusive languages through these methods we are able to properly judge how a person feels. interpretation of gray areas robots and computers function well when presented with quantifiable data. however once the situation enters a gray area whether this term refers to morals processes or definitions robots are more likely to falter. critical thinking humans are capable of responding to more indicators of quality than computers are. while an ai system may be able to analyze documents according to the true or false statements made within the text we can judge whether or not it is well written and analyze the implication of the use of certain words and the overall meaning of the content.,give rise smarter human intelligence form

4,41,machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make nick bostrom to put it frankly artificial intelligence will eventually replace jobs. workers in a variety of industries from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of artificial intelligence. if history has taught us anything it is that disruptive paradigm shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators but they also build the groundwork for new business models market entrants and job opportunities which will inevitably follow. it is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution. but that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here. we on the other hand will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes. according to seventy one percent of the businesses worldwide artificial intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives. artificial intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair according to a whopping eighty three percent of corporate leaders. these results demonstrate that artificial intelligence is steadily extending its measures yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives. since the advent of industry four. businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation be it any type of industry. in twoone3 researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work. they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. machine learning is responsible for this disruption. it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do. a research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy. here the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists. another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays. here too the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers. thus we can safely conclude that given the right data machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these. a teacher might read one essays over a four year career an ophthalmologist might see 5 eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutes. thus it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent high volume tasks. tasks where machines don t work but there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand and that is in novel tasks. machines can t handle things they haven t seen many times before. the fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data. but humans don t we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we haven t seen before. percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war two where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. here he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven. now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day. thus machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations. now as we all know that around 9two percent of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace. perhaps these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at. also creative tasks the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers attention and will have to stand out of the crowd. business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them. since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies. human contact would be essential in care giving and educational related work responsibilities and technology would take a backseat. health screenings and customer service face to face communication would advocate for human contact with artificial intelligence playing a supporting role. so what does this mean for the future of work the future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations today machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers over the coming years they re going to conduct audits they re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. but does that mean we re not going to be needing accountants and lawyers wrong. we re still going to need them for complex tax structuring for path breaking litigation. it will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks. amazon has recruited more than one robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than eight people. humans pick and pack goods amazon has over foureight products on its shelves while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses therefore reducing the amount of walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted. furthermore because amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans the robots enable amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush hour traffic. more inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roof. kodak once an undisputed giant of the photography industry had a 9 percent share in the usa market in one thousand nine hundred seventy six and by one9eightfour they were employing one four5 people. but in the year twoonetwo they had a net worth of negative dollar one billion and they had to declare bankruptcy. why because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology. on the other hand instagram a digital photography company started in twoonetwo with one3 employees and later they were sold to facebook for dollar one billion. this is so ironic because kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and didn t pay attention towards it and this created the problem. we live in an era of artificial intelligence ai which has given us tremendous computing power storage space and information access. we were given the spinning wheel in the first electricity in the second and computers in the third industrial revolution by the exponential growth of technology. airbnb which is a giant start up and is known for enabling homeowners to rent out their homes and couches to travellers for example is now creating a new artificial intelligence system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and convert them into actual products almost instantly. this might be a significant breakthrough whether you re a designer engineer or other type of technologist. differences that automation brings onto the table there are three key changes that automation can bring about at the macro level artificial intelligence isn t just a fad. tractica a market research firm published a report in twoone6 that predicted annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will expand from 6four3.seven million in twoone6 to dollar thirty six.eight billion by twotwo5 a 5seven fold increase over that time span. as a result it is the it industry s fastest growing segment of any size. the reduction in need for people as a result of artificial intelligence and related technologies which resulted in job layoffs was a cause of fear. in india alone job losses in the it sector have reportedly reached one in the last year owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. most of the it companies such as infosys wipro tcs and cognizant have reduced their employee base in india and are recruiting less while engaging more personnel in the united states and investing heavily in centres of innovation. artificial intelligence and data science which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad aren t helping the prospects of local employees. another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers. unfortunately it s a drop in the bucket compared to what robots are doing to information technology s less skilled brothers. large e commerce sites that used to be operated by armies of people are now manned by two robots produced by greyorange which is an indian company based out in gurgaon. these indefatigable robots lift and stack boxes twofour hours a day with only a 3 minute break for recharging and have cut employees by up to eight percent . for efficiency this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects. internal re skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour. artificial intelligence has presented indian policymakers with epistemological scientific and ethical issues. this requires us to abandon regular linear and non disruptive mental patterns. the tale of artificial intelligence s influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time. it is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry s current trends and demands. so will machines be able to take over many of our jobs the answer is a resounding yes. however for every job that is taken over by robots there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do. some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature. others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships assisting each other in doing what they do best. in the future people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for.,machine intelligence invention humanity make bostrom put frankly artificial intelligence

5,42,where is this disruptive technology taking us take it or leave it disruptive technology always creates new jobs much more than depleted jobs. you might notice certain jobs disappearing but those jobs are the jobs that transform humans to robots to machines and the technology is creating machines to replace them. technology creates the data analysis tools to manipulate and create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence ai big data and machine learning ml algorithms to predict and drive consumer behavior. data analytics tools such as google analytics and others are available today for free and if used correctly can help organizations save millions maybe billions of dollars of sales and marketing. before i go on i think it s best to level set on what constitutes machines. in the context of this article machines describe computers and computerized equipment like robots that have been programmed to learn sometimes like humans. occasionally we call this artificial intelligence ai other times we call this machine learning and still other times we call this robotics. and yes these are technically different things. these bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day. they can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being. but within the broad discussion related to the future of work these are totally interrelated. factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them. a machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them. but with every forward step advancement in technology a threat is proliferating a threat of being replaced on our work front. every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe. similarly ai is being used to turn hand drawn sketches done by humans into digital source code. companies are clearly developing their ai and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they ll be able to of course it s not just machines and creatives working together either. in another example amazon has employed more than one hundred robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than eighty . humans in amazon s case do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses essentially cutting down on the walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired. plus the robots allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans. the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof which means better selection for customers. during the next few decades or maybe sooner the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability. as they are starting to do today machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable tasks that require creativity problem solving and flexibility. in this context robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers. although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation it is also true that highly repetitive tasks and even mechanical ones are ideal for robots. besides greater efficiency and speed automation leads to a lower risk of accidents greater control and autonomy and above all fewer costs for organizations. although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence in fact they don t yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns. so as things stand however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has it doesn t beat factors innate to the human brain. humans are still a very essential part of the process. think about delivering services to a client. most customer challenges are routine but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues solving them the first time they appear and then consolidating the process into the system. while machines and humans are placed in proximity robots can be expensive but this doesn t apply to all types especially those based on robotic process automation rpa where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs. moreover think of how domestic robots be it a vacuum cleaner a lawn mower or a pool cleaner are increasingly part of our daily lives. this level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control security and comfort. the division between humans and machines has been clear i m here the machine is there but that boundary is getting fuzzier. smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength stability or resilience as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workers. we use our smartphones symbiotically but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain. think it sounds like science fiction think again. the first prototypes have already been built. soon brain computer interfaces could become seamless as well creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us. at that point the question of who knows what would be moot you ask me a question and i know the answer. sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web. our brain s decision process is influenced by the way it has been educated by the cultural context. these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains can t be held accountable for the choices made. the point i m trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools both physical and conceptual that we have been taught to use. my guess is that the transformation will be subtle. practically speaking robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern. none of this is expected in the near future not by a long shot. if you ve been to an atm waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right. before they can take over all of our jobs they need to be able to do theirs flawlessly until then we can depend on humans to mess up our lives. this isn t a win or lose situation. we re going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology. machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and as with any successful technology they will fall below our level of perception. in the end the revolution will be silent and invisible.,disruptive technology taking leave disruptive technology creates

6,43,in future or in upcoming years humans and machines are going to work together in every field of work. in upcoming days machines will be the need for every human being. machines ai technology will do the work which humans are incapable of doing. machines will partner and co operate with humans. according to the professor at the university of washington he explained that as a result of ai there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. human workers and machines will work together flawlessly complementing each other. machines will learn to carry out easier tasks such as following processes or crunching data. they will also help the humans while difficult. machines or ai will create a great job opportunities for humans in future. john kelly ll executive vice president of ibm once said that man and machines working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently. in future the three sectors of our country like agriculture sector industrial sector and service sector are going to utilize the machines. so that their work becomes not difficult. as of now we can only see that for agriculture purposes various kinds of machines are used which we called as a modern farming method. some major technologies machines that are harvest automation autonomous tractors seeding and weeing and drones. as a result farms can do agriculture peacefully. in the industrial sector also humans and machines are working together to increase production. various types of machines are used in industries such as packing machines loading machine etc. humans provide instructions to the machines and maintain the management in the company. soon robots machines will assist doctors with surgeries. for instance a doctor at remote location could direct a surgical robot to perform an open heart surgery. but the approaches option and decision will be left to experience and wisdom of the doctor not the robot. what do you think of machines if they will make humans less or more in the field machines will push human professionals up the skillset ladder into uniquely human skills such as creativity social abilities empathy and sense making which machines cannot automate. as a result machines will make the workplace more not less for humans. however humans have to learn new skills throughout their lives. it is said that in the future eighty percent of process oriented tasks will be done by machines. quantitative reasoning tasks will be done approximately fifty percent by humans and fifty percent by machines while humans will continue to do more than eighty percent of cross functional reasoning tasks. according to harvard research machines algorithms can read diagnostic scans with ninety two percent accuracy. humans can do it with ninety six percent accuracy. together it will be ninety nine percent accurate. human machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in the novel more effective ways. smart machines are helping humans to expand their abilities in three ways. they can amplify our cognitive strengths interact with customers and employees to free us from higher level tasks and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities. in the research it was found that one fifty0 companies achieve the most significant performance improvement when humans and machines work together. new machine systems have beyond human cognitive abilities which many of us fear could potentially dehumanize the future of work. machines will indeed automate most repetitive and physical tasks and part of quantitative tasks such as programming and even data science. according to d.e shaw group and professor at the university of washington explained that as a

7,44,in future or in upcoming years humans and machines are going to work together in every field of work. in upcoming days machines will be the need for every human being. machines ai technology will do the work which humans are incapable of doing. machines will partner and co operate with humans. according to the professor at the university of washington he explained that as a result of ai there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today. human workers and machines will work together flawlessly complementing each other. machines will learn to carry out easier tasks such as following processes or crunching data. they will also help the humans while difficult. machines or ai will create a great job opportunities for humans in future. john kelly ll executive vice president of ibm once said that man and machines working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently. in future the three sectors of our country like agriculture sector industrial sector and service sector are going to utilize the machines. so that their work becomes not difficult. as of now we can only see that for agriculture purposes various kinds of machines are used which we called as a modern farming method. some major technologies machines that are harvest automation autonomous tractors seeding and weeing and drones. as a result farms can do agriculture peacefully. in the industrial sector also humans and machines are working together to increase production. various types of machines are used in industries such as packing machines loading machine etc. humans provide instructions to the machines and maintain the management in the company. soon robots machines will assist doctors with surgeries. for instance a doctor at remote location could direct a surgical robot to perform an open heart surgery. but the approaches option and decision will be left to experience and wisdom of the doctor not the robot. what do you think of machines if they will make humans less or more in the field machines will push human professionals up the skillset ladder into uniquely human skills such as creativity social abilities empathy and sense making which machines cannot automate. as a result machines will make the workplace more not less for humans. however humans have to learn new skills throughout their lives. it is said that in the future eighty percent of process oriented tasks will be done by machines. quantitative reasoning tasks will be done approximately fifty percent by humans and fifty percent by machines while humans will continue to do more than eighty percent of cross functional reasoning tasks. according to harvard research machines algorithms can read diagnostic scans with ninety two percent accuracy. humans can do it with ninety six percent accuracy. together it will be ninety nine percent accurate. human machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in the novel more effective ways. smart machines are helping humans to expand their abilities in three ways. they can amplify our cognitive strengths interact with customers and employees to free us from higher level tasks and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities. in the research it was found that one fifty0 companies achieve the most significant performance improvement when humans and machines work together. new machine systems have beyond human cognitive abilities which many of us fear could potentially dehumanize the future of work. machines will indeed automate most repetitive and physical tasks and part of quantitative tasks such as programming and even data science. according to d.e shaw group and professor at the university of washington explained that as a

8,45,machine learning techniques may have been used for years but recently there has been an explosion in their applications. in fact in a recent q3 earnings call google ceo sundar pichai said machine learning is a core transformative way by which we re re thinking how we re doing everything. and they re far from the only business making that claim. in the past successful use of machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms and huge r d budgets but all that is changing. ibm watson microsoft azure amazon and alibaba all launched turnkey cloud based machine learning saas solutions in two thousand fifteen. at the same time startups like idibon metamind dato and monkeylearn have built machine learning products that companies can take advantage of. gartner already puts machine learning at the top of its hype curve and no machine learning won t replace all of your employees with computers or suddenly double your revenue. but that doesn t mean that it can t give every business a competitive advantage. there are plenty of business processes that can significantly benefit from machine learning. so how does machine learning change the way businesses operate first thing s first machine learning needs training data and training data costs money. especially training data labeled by humans. let me explain. to make machine learning work for business the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what it s supposed to be doing. if you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads. if you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets. if you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language. in some instances a company may have those training sets in house. for example a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads. but say you haven t labeled each of your support tickets as they ve come in over the year. you d need to have people either in house or en masse via a data enrichment platform label those tickets. the machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from. machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well. the downside is that it often works well in eighty percent of the cases and badly in twenty percent of the cases and lowering the twenty percent error rate is hard if not impossible. but even an eighty percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors. smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans. banks have been doing this for years. when you put a check in an atm an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check. if you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human. this design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy. a huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost. if you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm. this is a well studied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much much more efficiently. as the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest rarest situations. that means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones. and if that sounds like smart business it s because it is.,machine learning techniques

9,46,elearning as technology becomes more affordable in higher education but having a big barrier in the cost of developing its resources. deep learning using artificial intelligence continues to become more and more popular and having impacts on many areas of elearning. it offers online learners of the future intuitive algorithms and automated delivery of elearning content through modern lms platforms. this paper aims to survey various applications of deep learning approaches for developing the resources of the elearning platform in which predictions algorithms and analytics come together to create more personalized future elearning experiences. in addition deep learning models for developing the contents of the elearning platform deep learning framework that enable deep learning systems into elearning and its development benefits future trends of deep learning in elearning the relevant deep learning based artificial intelligence tools and a platform enabling the developer and learners to quickly reuse resources are clearly summarized. thus deep learning has evolved into developing ways to re purpose existing resources that can mitigate the expense of content development of future elearning. it is natural to wonder where you might get ai tools to avoid the time and expense of developing your own. don t worry about the advert of aiaas or ai as a service even small education or learning development professionals can purchase the license of ai tools and components. however such types of tools cannot be useful for every e learning ecosystem but may offer some enticing benefits such as adding standard ai tasks logic decision making to your toolbox. here are some of the aiaas tools and platforms offered by famous tech giants most of which are cloud based. microsoft azure cloud based ai services that can be used to build and manage ai applications like image recognition or bot based apps ibm s watson cloud based ai services that can be integrated into your applications to store and manage your own data google s tensor flow an end to end open source machine learning platform amazon web services offers a wide range of products and services on amazon s cloud there are other aiaas platforms such as datarobot petuum and h2o which shows that the field is expanding.ai will probably not make human workers obsolete at least not for a long time to put some of your fears to bed the robots are probably not coming for your jobs at least not yet. given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media in particular in some of our favorite sci fi movies it s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that ai will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce. after all as technology has advanced many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated. it s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it. but i don t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic. a recent paper published by the mit task force on the work of the future entitled artificial intelligence and the future of work looked closely at developments in ai and their relation to the world of work. the paper paints a more optimistic picture. rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor the paper predicts that ai will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs. while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks there are still major limitations. in particular ai programs are typically only capable of specialized intelligence meaning they can solve only one problem and execute only one task at a time. often they can be rigid and unable to respond to any changes in input or perform any thinking outside of their prescribed programming. humans however possess generalized intelligence with the kind of problem solving abstract thinking and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business. human judgment will be relevant if not in every task then certainly throughout every level across all sectors. there are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in ai. ai often requires learning which can involve massive amounts of data calling into question the availability of the right kind of data and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data. there is also the limitation of computation and processing power. the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at dollar four.six million. another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data. if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the ai. there has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade commission to investigate the use of any new ai technology for the potential to perpetuate bias. based on these factors and many others the mit cci paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which ai is comparable to human intelligence and could theoretically replace human workers entirely. provided there is an investment at all levels from education to the private sector and governmental organizations anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers ai has the potential to ultimately create more jobs not less. the question should then become not humans or computers but humans and computers involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity. this paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into ai and the many potential directions in which it may lead.ai is becoming standard in all businesses not just in the world of tech a couple of times recently ai has come up in conversation with a client or an associate and i m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it. there seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world. in case you hadn t noticed the tech world is the world these days. don t ever forget when economist paul krugman said in one thousand nine hundred ninety eight that by two thousand five or so it will become clear that the internet s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine s. you definitely don t want to be behind the curve when it comes to ai. in fact ninety percent of leading businesses already have ongoing investments in ai technologies. more than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of ai driven technology report experiencing greater productivity. ai is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular medical the potential benefits of utilizing ai in the field of medicine are already being explored. the medical industry has a robust amount of data which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare. additionally ai has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts. automotive we re already seeing how ai is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation. ai will also have a major impact on manufacturing including within the automotive sector. cybersecurity cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout two thousand twenty. attacks rose six00 percent during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home on less secure technological systems and wi fi networks. ai and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. ai will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud. e commerce ai will play a pivotal role in e commerce in the future in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution. we can expect that moving forward ai will continue to drive e commerce including through the use of chat bots shopper personalization image based targeting advertising and warehouse and inventory automation. ai can have a big impact on the job search if you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application you might be in for a rude awakening. ai already plays a major role in the hiring process so much so that up to seventy five percent of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system or ats before they even reach a human being. in the past recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates. data from linkedin shows that recruiters can spend up to twenty three hours looking over resumes for one successful hire. increasingly however resume scanning is being done by ai powered programs. in two thousand eighteen six7 percent of hiring managers stated that ai was making their jobs easier. despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process many have been critical of the use of certain types of ai by hiring managers based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring. one particular example is illustrated by hirevue a startup whose initial services included technology that aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role. the electronic privacy information center filed a lawsuit with the federal trade commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice. hirevue discontinued the use of facial recognition software in early two thousand twenty one and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing. it s clear that the use of certain types of ai in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops. however if potential employers are using ai to process your application there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage. jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager. by comparing your resume to a job description jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position with the goal of beating an applicant tracking system ats . jobseer is a browser add on and another great ai based tool for those on the job market. based on a scan of your resume as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience. for each listing you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience. rezi now as a disclaimer i would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot. but rezi is an awesome ai based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems. this is a great jumping off point to kickstart a new resume. another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up and identify some areas for improvement. ai is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market especially when you consider that ai will have such far reaching impacts across many industries.ai and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today s job market. jobs requesting ai or machine learning skills are expected to increase by seventy one percent in the next five years. if you d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on ai skills. if you are tech savvy it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the ai space. if your skills lie elsewhere it is important to recognize that ai will have a big impact and to the extent of your abilities you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors. ai is definitely here to stay whether we like it or not. personally i don t think we have anything to be afraid of. the best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us ai included. this article was updated on april 1six two thousand twenty one to reflect changes in hirevue s assessment tools.,elearning

10,47,before the internet information was in some ways restricted and more centralized. the only mediums of information were books newspapers and word of mouth etc. but now with the advent of the internet and improvements to computer technology moore s law information and data skyrocketed and it has become this open system where information can be distributed to people without any kind of limits. various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting and decrypting email and files. data encryption isn t just for technology geeks modern tools make it possible for anyone to encrypt emails and other information. encryption used to be the sole province of geeks and mathematicians but a lot has changed in recent years. in particular various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting and decrypting email and files. gpg for mail for example is an open source plug in for the apple mail program that makes it easy to encrypt decrypt sign and verify emails using the openpgp standard. and for protecting files newer versions of apple s os x operating system come with filevault a program that encrypts the hard drive of a computer. those running microsoft windows have a similar program. this software will scramble your data but won t protect you from government authorities demanding your encryption key under the regulation of investigatory powers act two thousand which is why some aficionados recommend truecrypt a program with some very interesting facilities which might have been useful to david miranda explains john naughton in an article for the guardian. one of the most basic yet often overlooked data protection tips is backing up your data. basically this creates a duplicate copy of your data so that if a device is lost stolen or compromised you don t also lose your important information. as the u.s. chamber of commerce and insurance company nationwide points out according to nationwide sixty eight percent of small businesses don t have a disaster recovery plan. the problem with this is the longer it takes you to restore your data the more money you ll lose. gartner found that this downtime can cost companies as much as dollar three hundred an hour. while you should use sound security practices when you re making use of the cloud it can provide an ideal solution for backing up your data. since data is not stored on a local device it s easily accessible even when your hardware becomes compromised. cloud storage where data is kept offsite by a provider is a guarantee of adequate disaster recovery according to this post on techradar. twitter at techradar scammers are sneaky sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. malware is a serious issue plaguing many computer users and it s known for cropping up in inconspicuous places unbeknownst to users. anti malware protection is essential for laying a foundation of security for your devices. malware short for malicious software is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer without your consent. malware includes computer viruses worms trojan horses spyware scareware and more. it can be present on websites and emails or hidden in downloadable files photos videos freeware or shareware. however it should be noted that most websites shareware or freeware applications do not come with malware. the best way to avoid getting infected is to run a good anti virus protection program do periodic scans for spyware avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites. but scammers are sneaky sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website. even the most cautious of web surfers will likely pick up an infection at some point. explains clark howard. twitter at clarkhoward much information can be gleaned through old computing devices but you can protect your personal data by making hard drives unreadable before disposing of them. make old computers hard drives unreadable. after you back up your data and transfer the files elsewhere you should sanitize by disk shredding magnetically cleaning the disk or using software to wipe the disk clean. destroy old computer disks and backup tapes according to the florida office of the attorney general. twitter at agpambondi operating system updates are a gigantic pain for users it s the honest truth. but they re a necessary evil as these updates contain critical security patches that will protect your computer from recently discovered threats. failing to install these updates means your computer is at risk. no matter which operating system you use it s important that you update it regularly. windows operating systems are typically updated at least monthly typically on so called patch tuesday. other operating systems may not be updated quite as frequently or on a regular schedule. it s best to set your operating system to update automatically. the method for doing so will vary depending upon your particular operating system says privacyrights.org. twitter at privacytoday many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. in order to ensure that you re downloading the latest security updates from operating systems and other software enable automatic updates. many software programs will automatically connect and update to defend against known risks. turn on automatic updates if that s an available option suggests staysafeonline.org. twitter at staysafeonline a valuable tip for both small business owners and individuals or families it s always recommended to secure your wireless network with a password. this prevents unauthorized individuals within proximity to hijack your wireless network. even if they re merely attempting to get free wi fi access you don t want to inadvertently share private information with other people who are using your network without permission. if you have a wi fi network for your workplace make sure it is secure encrypted and hidden. to hide your wi fi network set up your wireless access point or router so it does not broadcast the network name known as the service set identifier ssid . password protect access to the router says fcc.gov in an article offering data protection tips for small businesses. twitter at fcc when you re finished using your computer or laptop power it off. leaving computing devices on and most often connected to the internet opens the door for rogue attacks. leaving your computer connected to the internet when it s not in use gives scammers twenty four seven access to install malware and commit cybercrimes. to be safe turn off your computer when it s not in use suggests csid a division of experian. twitter at experianps_na firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs viruses or spyware before they infiltrate your system. firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs viruses or spyware before they infiltrate your system. various software companies offer firewall protection but hardware based firewalls like those frequently built into network routers provide a better level of security says geek squad. twitter at geeksquad indiana university information technology recommends following the principle of least privilege polp do not log into a computer with administrator rights unless you must do so to perform specific tasks. running your computer as an administrator or as a power user in windows leaves your computer vulnerable to security risks and exploits. simply visiting an unfamiliar internet site with these high privilege accounts can cause extreme damage to your computer such as reformatting your hard drive deleting all your files and creating a new user account with administrative access. when you do need to perform tasks as an administrator always follow security procedures. twitter at indianauniv what s the difference we recommend you use passphrases a series of random words or a sentence. the more characters your passphrase has the stronger it is. the advantage is these are much easier to remember and type but still hard for cyber attackers to hack. explains sans. twitter at sansawareness encrypt your sim card in case your phone is ever stolen or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone. encrypting your data on your removable storage devices can make it more difficult albeit not impossible for criminals to interpret your personal data should your device become lost or stolen. usb drives and sim cards are excellent examples of removable storage devices that can simply be plugged into another device enabling the user to access all the data stored on it. unless of course it s encrypted. your usb drive could easily be stolen

11,48,we all hear day in and day out that we amidst a technological revolution. but do we know what this really means before we understand how its going to impact us let us first discuss what these terms really mean. a technological revolution simply means that we are in a period where better and newer technologies replace the others to get the job done faster and better. we are in an era with rapid innovations where machines are being compared to humans. so then what is machine learning machine learning is basically the application of artificial intelligence into electronic systems to enable them to learn and enhance themselves without being programmed by humans. it is the evolution and development of computer programs that can access data and then use it to advance themselves. whether you know it or not you use machine learning powered applications daily. now what is artificial intelligence at its simplest form artificial intelligence is a field which combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem solving. in simple words artificial intelligence is the technology that facilitates these machines to perform human like behaviour. just like every other industry machine learning is playing its role in the finance and banking industry too. in most cases where a human would perform the same task by performing the same calculations or following the same process can be taught to the machine which can now perform it by itself. let us discuss a few examples of the applications that we might have come in our day to day running which are a result of machine learning in this industry portfolio management in earlier days an investor would need to consult a financial advisor to understand his her risk appetite and advise accordingly. today using machine learning algorithms there exists the concept of a robo advisor that requires any user to give certain inputs about their financial status and goals and calculates their risk tolerance and constructs and idle portfolio allocation for them. young users today find this extremely useful rather than physically visiting an advisor and paying a fee for doing so. risk underwriting underwriting is one of the core functions for most financial institutions especially banks and insurance companies where they are required to underwrite the risk of the customers before loaning out money or insurance policies. these underwriting activities are based on trends and thumb rules industrywide. the same has been introduced through machine learning which is able to underwrite risks today on a larger and more accurate scale. algorithmic trading machine learning is a mathematical model that tracks market information analyses massive data sources and study market conditions simultaneously to detect patterns which can be used for trading. this is humanly impossible to do in a fraction of time. algorithmic systems can make millions of trades daily often known as high frequency trading . it is highly believed that deep learning is playing its role in calibrating real time trading decisions. fraud detection with the increase in use and dependency on computers for financial transactions came the data security risk. there is an ample amount of valuable data stored online available to create potential risk. machine learning thus helped in fraud detection by detecting anomalies in transactions and flagging them for scrutiny based on the risk factors defined by the institutions. fraud identification in insurance claims credit card payments identity theft account theft are all areas in fraud detection that machine learning can help in. process automation process automation is one of the most common applications of machine learning in finance. the technology has helped in replacing manual work automate repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy and as a result increase productivity. machine learning has benefitted these organizations to optimize costs improve customer experiences and scale up their services. some examples of financial and banking firms using process automation are the use of chatbots automated calls paperwork automation and gamified employee training. customer onboarding in this highly competitive industry customer acquisition and the customer onboarding process is highly relevant in building a good customer relationship. at any stage during the onboarding a slight inconvenience or delay can act as a barrier. machine learning enabled complete automation in this process for these financial and banking institutions. today from opening an account filing for any application can be completed within a few minutes with utmost ease. with ai customers behavioral patterns have been studied to improvise and make the whole process efficient and user friendly. customer churn with the multitude of offerings and availability of a plethora of options customer stickiness is a big problem faced by financial firms. customer churn forecasting is one of the best big data use cases. it helps in detecting customers who cancel their subscription and analyses the same to tailor products as per customer needs. video streaming application netflix s subscribers worldwide has continued to grow to reach one hundred sixty seven million through using machine learning analytics on their customer database. decision making financial and banking institutions function on facilitating investments made by their customers. organizations are constantly in search of customers from whom they can get more revenue. this is now possible through performing machine learning analysis on both structured and unstructured data which helps them make more informed decisions. it also analyses data from the website and mobile application to construct effective marketing campaigns for the targeted customers. future of machine learning in finance financial monitoring security analysis prevention of money laundering network security investment predictions personalization of customer service everything comes under the realm of the applications of machine learning in the financial and banking industry. yet this is just the tip of the iceberg there is a lot more that is going to change in the future. it is now visibly imperative that while ai is beginning to create a wave of transformation across these industries and adapting to these changes s important for one s survival. with smart technology applied everywhere all financial firms are bound to turn into fintech s to stay relevant to the silver tech generation consisting of millennials and the genzs. final thoughts the financial services industry has entered the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the pace is not surprising knowing the positive changes it has brought. machine learning has the most use cases in finance than any other industry because of the available computer power and new machine learning tools. the greatest applications include simplifying customer engagement and accurate sales forecasting. it is only making this industry better and more efficient with each new adaptation. machine learning algorithms have the capability to deal with a lot more than human capacity along with eliminating human error. as even the algorithms are constantly learning and innovating they can serve as a bridge to a completely flawless automated financial system in the future. nonetheless the challenges of high cost and lack of resources that come along play a significant role in how early these firms can adopt these technologies. but even then the future seems bright as the industry has enough adopters and prospects ready to explore.,hear amidst technological revolution understand impact discuss terms

12,49,it s the year two thousand sixty. an automaton in a research laboratory says to a scientist warning error occurred reformatting hard disk now the scientist panics. automaton says again ha ha just kidding . funny right. before some of you say that this joke isn t realistic how can an automaton tell you a joke but what if i tell you in two thousand seventeen sofia the robot made a joke on the show good morning britain who thought computers could tell us a joke hard to believe well the idea of giving computers human enjoy thinking has now become a reality. thanks to the technological advancement in ai in the last decade. before diving deep into how ai can impact the future of work let s begin with the simple question what s ai artificial intelligence provides machines the power to think from data. the machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trends. with the rise of ai humans are divided into one question. are machines human s friend or foe tech executives and politicians on conference stages campaign rallies and even science fiction hollywood movies like carbon black westworld minority report and ex machina have given their take on this question. some believe ai will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of ai will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world we all know. stephen hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman ai that eventually would escape earth to a new planet. no this isn t a plot of black mirror. right now superhumans may not be a reality but ai is. homo deus the emergence of the new digital god using ai. god must also worry as ai might take his job. here s some career advice have you thought about being a robot the fear that ai would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today. statistics show that nearly thirty seven percent of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots. while another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of ai with result in automating most of the jobs in the future however it also will create millions of new job opportunities. ai is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks. for example buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a human less interaction. each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by fourteen percent . at this rate it s predicted that the twenty million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automation. the coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation. the robotic process automation rpa software industry has experienced an increase of nineteen.fifty three percent in the year twenty21. coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in technology that reduces human contact as minimal for making workplaces safe. our workplaces will look much different in the next five to ten years. ai will help humans in simplifying repetitive processes. the two most important catalysts for the future of work are the two d s digitization and datafication. digitalization is converting data to digital formats computer readable . for example text to html analog video to youtube video. digitization helps in increasing data exponentially. datafication is quantifying human life to data and improving the data driven business model. by twentytwenty five it is forecasted that the digital transformation space will build in a dollar three two hundred ninety four billion industry one thing is clear no data no future of work. what we find is that the future of data and the future of work will go hand in hand. the total volume of data in the datasphere that is created captured copied and consumed in the world is predicted to reach one hundred seventy five zettabytes by twentytwenty five. to give you a much better picture for understanding if we represent the digital universe as stacks of tablets there would be twenty seven.twenty five stacks from earth to the moon. it s time to prepare for the data dominated future as industry four. fourth industrial revolution has begun. so let s see how artificial intelligence will affect the following fields human resource nowadays recruiters use ai powered tools for hiring workers. using these tools recruiters get insights into a candidate s skills personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization. for example the company allyo first identifies high potential candidates through assessment and smart screening and then automatically schedules interviews using ai. hr departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening. entry level roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated. ai will automate specific hr jobs not hr roles. a deloitte study found that ai has already eliminated 8 low skilled jobs in the uk but three.five million new jobs were also created. roles that focus on complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department will continue to be a very human endeavor. finance and accounting in twenty1five a report from accenture named finance twentytwenty death by digital predicted that four percent of transactional accounting work would be automated by twentytwenty. has technology replaced the human factor well ai has created new jobs involving managing the ai system and using the information to create insights. for example accounting software has already automated bookkeeping tasks that used to be done by humans but that s only opened the door for former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients. advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team. using the information gained from transactions in books the team creates insights to improve business strategy. owing to automation the team spends more time analyzing numbers. marketing and sales marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the company s resources managing time and achieving budget targets. marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would. in this process marketers and machines both excel in different parts. marketers using ai tools drive more conversions in less time. human intelligence with technology can help identify the right customers to talk to and at the right time. modern marketers understand the insights from any marketing campaign and create it into effective messaging. engineering technology is changing in a blink of an eye. the technologies used five years ago in the industry have become obsolete today. engineers will have to keep up with the technological advancements and keep upgrading their skills to stay relevant in the industry. learning to work alongside machines and designing work such that interaction better humans and machines are better are going to be important skills for engineers in the future. in the 18th and nineteenth centuries the rise of the industrial revolution centuries led to millions of people losing their jobs because of scientific advancements. but that also ended in creating millions of other jobs. statisticians have said when automation destroys jobs people find new ones. thus ai holds a more optimistic picture for the future. in the future ai is not going to replace humans rather make jobs more humane. ai will disrupt millions of middle and entry level jobs in the next few years but will also create millions of additional jobs and help to boost economies.,automaton research laboratory scientist warning error occurred reformatting hard disk scientist panics automaton kidding funny joke isn

13,50,the way work is being done now is destined to undergo massive transformational changes which will impact humans and their ways of working dramatically. with the development of the new machine programs a.i. is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did. now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too. and robots will overcome us in our fields of work. at present we are being surrounded by a.i. from dusk till dawn from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well. it is believed that a.i. has grown over two hundred seventy percent over the last years. first let us know what a.i. is and all the fuss going on about it a.i. as defined by the internet is simply simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions . this translates to it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with one hundred percent accuracy.in my definition i would define a.i. as the god form of human beings. now the question that arises is what does a.i. entails for the future a.i. is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers. with its introduction to different areas of the workplace it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by a.i. and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming ai based ventures in different industries. thereby giving us our fair share back to us. in a survey it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech savvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals. people believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices. more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient. the organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using a.i. and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher end technology systems as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run. many jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology. beyond just training and developing these machines humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine. it can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human can t remain in the workforce without each other as the technology will produce accurate and top notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g. in a firm an ai based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization. various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day to day functions in regards to interactions with humans are artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms neural networks and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help ai in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided. whereas humans on the other hand take higher level decisions based on intuition sometimes which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge. ai alone can t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders and humans alone can t anticipate much on the accurate and fast paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation. the strength of humans and ai working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations. it is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs. but the reality seems to be turning otherwise. the future trend shows that in future the ai powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them. as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies and so in the future we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically. some of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be one hundred percent automated in the future years. there is an amazon go store that uses this technology which goes by the name just walk out technology wherein there is no need for any human induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by ai powered technologies which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today s world. rather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back. there will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as gen z . they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand. these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions. ai powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage. it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around dollar four.six million. so this super powered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth. one of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report. these machines as do not have neuroscience based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time. it is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer no matter it is fast paced but they are not intelligent. businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today s dynamic changing technology. while it s still unclear what does the future holds for us but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways. as we are unclear about what the future looks like we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization.the training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won t be only limited to pg degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning. as the covid nineteen changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre covid and post covid scenario. employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work. policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization. there needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them not all trends will be beneficial for organizations they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently. there lies a possibility in future certain years from now we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking why are the curtains blue would be able to clean cars play politics and tell jokes to us and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us. that s how good machines will be in the future but to make ourselves competitive with machines we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us. humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties. machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs but let me make you sleep peacefully tonight the machines aren t arriving until we re retired.,work destined undergo massive transformational impact humans ways working dramatically development machine programs ai set humans workplace competition beings robots robots overcome

14,51,artificial intelligence and employment are the burning issues nowadays workers need clarity on as we head into the longer term. this article focuses on the various impact of ai on our jobs and explains the benefits of ai in our workplace. that right there must have hit a nerve. however everything is about to change because this article highlights some of the reasons we should not fear ai. ai is the abbreviation of artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence is often defined as a set of various technologies which will be brought together to permit machines to act with what appears to be human like levels of intelligence. this includes learning rules required to make certain decisions and reasoning to arrive at certain conclusions learning from past experiences and self correction. ai is of two types. one thousand nine hundred forty expectations that machines could match humans in terms of general intelligence. by that we mean machines could have the capability to find out reason and react. one thousand nine hundred fifty alan turing develops the turing test a test to determine whether a machine is intelligent.however it wasn t for another sixty years or so that any program was deemed to have passed. one thousand nine hundred fifty five the first time a computer virus defeats a person s world champion during a parlor game. one thousand nine hundred fifty six john mccarthy invents the new term artificial intelligence when he held the primary academic conference on the subject of ai. one thousand nine hundred sixty two arthur samuel s machine learning checkers draughts program beat a checkers master. one thousand nine hundred eighty reinforcement learning is introduced. this is a kind of programming that uses rewards and punishments to coach a machine to interact with its environment. two thousand twelve a research group led by geoffrey hinton wins the image net competition this competition requires ai to categorize about one.two million images into any of one0 different categories. the level of accuracy was adequate to that of the typical human completing an equivalent task manually. two0one4 eugene goostman s chatbot a bot pretending to be a one3 year old boy supposedly passes the turing test a test which nobody has passed before but controversy arose with this claim as one. experts claim it only lasted five minutes. two. it had been deemed biased as eugene s mother tongue ukrainian wasn t equivalent to the judge s english which is a plus as language is one among the few ways we will tell the difference between a person s and machine. two0one8 alibaba s ai model performs better than humans during a reading and comprehension test at stanford university scoring 8two.forty four against the 8two.three hundred four scored by humans artificial intelligence ai is here to remain and lots of people aren t happy. after all it s hard to embrace something that would displace about forty percent of human jobs within the next one5 years. in an interview for cbs s hour kai fu lee a chinese ai expert also mentioned truck drivers chauffeurs waiters and chefs as a number of the professions that will be disrupted. but if you were to ask the experts they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise ai is here to profit us all. case in point an executive briefing by the mckinsey global institute revealed that ai and automation are creating opportunities for the economy society and business. that said it s time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs. so let s highlight a number of the useful developments you ll expect from this technological phenomenon. while the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate it is still safe to say that ai will indeed offer new opportunities. according to the planet economic forum report robots and ai will create as many ai jobs as they displace. this conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence for example data scientists who evaluate the decisions made by ai algorithms to eliminate any biases. apart from that some other ai occupations include transparency analysts people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms. smart system interaction modelers experts who develop machine behavior based on employee behavior. machine relations managers people that champion the greater use of algorithms that perform well. as far because the competition for jobs between humans and robots goes worth noting is that there are jobs that ai can t replace. roles that need leadership empathy and delegation are samples of the various jobs that are safe from automation. automation will stir positive change in the workplace. when ai is employed during recruitment or maybe performance management all workers are going to be evaluated in an unbiased fact based manner. in turn human resources managers can get to consider other essential strategic undertakings that ensure balance within the workplace. ai can help hr departments to use machine learning ml in discovering where issues like bias stem from and assist them to act accordingly faster. ml shines in identifying instances of bias. in turn this may promote fairness and variety within the work setting. the impact of ai in business is already felt and this is often expected to continue through to the longer term. a few years from now ai oriented architecture is forecasted to require the lead in assisting businesses to hold out operations in additional comprehensive ways thus shifting them from traditional data science and machine learning models. it will be necessary to maneuver to business outcomes because ai will play an important role in multiple aspects of the business. while there is no way of telling the future of artificial intelligence in business for sure it makes sense for owners to keep up with the evolution to avoid being left behind. the workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity. businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying ai automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast. with statistics showing that workers spend up to forty percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated. automation is not new machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decades. however within the coming years mundane daily tasks will become fully automated. already thirty nine percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in two0one8. with repetitive tasks taken care of employees can focus their energies on high value customer oriented tasks and collaboration. the designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of ai technology. more people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agile. companies that implement ai in their business strategy will experience dramatic improvements in their customer experiences and their employees are going to be more motivated. encouraging creativity rather than the performance of repetitive tasks gives workers more fulfillment in their jobs as well. with the web of things and ai working hand in hand identifying trends and solving problems within the business world will become more convenient and also sustainable. ai alongside other technologies is predicted to vary the planet by impacting the way businesses run. with time we ll be ready to combine both human and artificial brains to seek out solutions to major global problems. it will even be easier to foresee problems with more accuracy and nip them at the bud with the help of ai. but these positive impacts can only be felt if stakeholders are transparent and mindful in their use of the technology for the greater good of everyone else. according to a report by pwc fifty four percent of companies confirm that the implementation of ai driven solutions in their companies has already improved productivity. ai and automation even once they are implemented partially have unlimited potential for any business. workers skills attitude training command chain and workflows protocols are a number of the leading productivity challenges that companies face. apart from increasing productivity ai systems will help businesses to chop down on costs improve the standard of their products or services and make better customer profiles. as a result companies also will get higher profits which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends or reinvest it back within the business. improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers. businesses can therefore use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by ai and cannot be automated. artificial intelligence isn t showing any signs of slowing down. soon it ll become another necessity of life a bit like the web. but for now more and more businesses are beginning to realize how invaluable ai automation and data interpretation are. though machines will take some jobs initially the roles created by automation will also keep soaring within the next few years. will we ve reached the purpose of accelerating human intelligence by artificial means who knows what we all know however is that those that are going to be sought after in ai and employment are individuals who have the relevant skills. there s work that not even the machines can do so we should make ourselves as valuable as we can be in our field and we will be irreplaceable.,artificial intelligence employment burning issues nowadays workers clarity longer term article focuses impact jobs explains benefits workplace hit nerve change article

16,53,ai experts believe it s going to be one of the main drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and that it has the potential to not just transform the tech sectors and going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand themselves better rather than the outside world with ai because people who are naysayer and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible. after all in the next five to ten years ai is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a renaissance a golden age of machine learning and artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades. ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like self driving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like self driving technology viable for the first time three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and that s been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster that s like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you don t have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe that s reasonable was just not possible and the third thing that s happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so technology has been changing and developing at a pace that s much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how it s going to impact our immediate future. the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what google s done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didn t happen overnight this started in two thousand four but the major change only happens to start two thousand twelve onwards google s taken away about sixty five percent of sales people s jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decade. in present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what they re sick they can get treated better so it s going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self driving cars they re going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speech recognition or image recognition that the performance levels are phenomenal or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for tb and hiv developing that s notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the latest release of windows ten has this capability called ij s which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type. like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of ai as well bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind. because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but it s important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature it s that it s going to evolve as technology and in particular ai can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think if they re not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by oxford study that says forty seven percent of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that ninety seven percent of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined seven hundred participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesn t require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real time employees machines are faster can t be distracted and can work twenty four seven this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing creative content from beginning to end by two thousand thirty ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for seven0 percent of the referral marketing traffic and receive more than fifty percent of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we re about to see by two thousand twenty two it is estimated that twenty to twenty five percent of the labor force will be displaced within ten to twenty years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a good way to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a map of how ai and automation will affect industry and company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation it s too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they re not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isn t terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future adaptability.,experts drivers industrial revolution potential transform tech sectors open

18,55,advertising can be described as a type of specific content broadcasting to a larger audience the form can take several different forms and the intended message can differ from genre to genre. the target for each medium could be different. advertised content could be in print radio tv or digital formats. we ll look at how the advertising market has changed over the last ten decade. advertising is a form of communication that aims to persuade a target audience. typical advertising messages endorse programs goods concepts people and companies. first conventional types of advertising were used to carry out advertising. let s take a look at the traditional forms of advertising. advertising can include in flight advertising street furniture passenger displays billboards

advertising in the classified section of a newspaper is an example of press advertising. a billboard or digital screen placed on a moving vehicle is often referred to as a mobile billboard. when a brand or product is used in a large entertainment venue it is known as convert ads or guerrilla advertising. when a soft drink a watch or a pair of sneakers is seen or mentioned in a common film this is an example of this. ad in supermarket videos aisles and on the inside of shopping carts is referred to as in store advertising. consumers are influenced by celebrity advertisements because of the power of wealth fame and popularity. however if a celebrity falls out of favor the use of that celebrity may be detrimental to a company. religious organizations political parties political candidates and special interest groups are examples of noncommercial ads. these were the conventional forms of advertisement but as the internet and technology progressed the advertising industry began to play a

the content itself rather than serving an ad. this can take the form of publisher tailored content that the advertiser can support or content that the advertiser publishes directly. there are different kinds of businesses and websites that have used content marketing to grow and flourish in the industry. content marketing is a trend that has contributed a large amount of income to the advertisement industry. to summarise the advertising industry has evolved through time and will continue to do so as technology advances allowing advertisers to reach a wider audience and gain a greater understanding of the people to whom they are delivering material. the advertising industry will continue to develop in tandem with innovation. people are also becoming more jaded when it comes to advertisements pushing businesses to come up with new ways to convey their messages. however advertisement has a promising future.,advertising type specific content broadcasting larger audience

21,58,the covid nineteen pandemics forced factories to shut down flights getting canceled and a massive decrease in the global economy with a significant decrease in green house gases ghg in many developed and developing countries. the sars covtwo came into the spotlight in december two0nineteen and has impacted most of the countries till then. nearly one hundred thirty one million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around two.nine million according to world health organisation who . most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus. these policies caused adverse effects worldwide. one of the most important impacts of the covid nineteen pandemic is on the environment. there have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like air pollution has decreased dramatically as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns. there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise. environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics air traffics rail traffics and industrial activities. it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too. the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nation s governments has caused people to remain back at their homes. because of this the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased. due to all these changes the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantially. water pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities but the covid nineteen virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environment. to begin with some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic. in the united states and in many other european nation states waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers. this has resulted in an increase in the use of single use plastic bags instead of the re usable bags by many leading restaurants firms and corporations. for instance starbucks a leading coffee company during the month of march two0two0 has announced a short lived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cups. furthermore with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores shops restaurants and food outlets are closed making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high. this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual. there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually single use items that can be used only once before they are disposed of. some of these wastes include used masks personal protection kits and gloves. for instance nearly two00 tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan china. this is fifty tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhan. these organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution air pollution soil erosion and can harm the local flora and fauna. the demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of non woven fabrics. polyester polystyrene polyethylene and polycarbonate are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between two0grams to two5 grams sq. meter. these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plastic based products with a really high afterlife after being discarded. if not treated properly without discarding they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms. for example recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wastes. with recycling plants on hold piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day. this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane ch4 a greenhouse gas hence increasing the risk of global warming too. not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods but the local people are also getting affected. if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earth s atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes this could result in increases in earth s average temperature and can be harmful to future generations. many protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown. many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes. the employees ngos and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks marine conservation zones and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended. this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting illegal deforestation and fishing activities due to the absence of these people. the prohibition of eco tourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areas. some nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid nineteen virus. however according to who two0two0 no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water. despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with people s health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cells. the covid nineteen is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans. evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals. they are accountable for seventy five percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world. with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe various governments and agencies top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes especially the clinical and medical waste . likewise at the same time we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gears. in spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any post financial crisis . a similar case was observed during the two008 financial crash although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of one.three percent was observed but as the economy recovered in two0one0 emissions were at an all time high. after all only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic. to prevent future outbreaks we must address regularly the threats to the ecosystems and wildlife including habitat loss illegal trade pollution and climate change as human life depends on earth s life. if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it s the only safe surface less space to take a walk in then you begin to realize the beauty of nature. the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others. when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street make sure to wipe down any surfaces you come into contact with avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands.,covid

22,59,even though covid nineteen has not yet halted and we are facing the nth wave of the coronavirus outbreak across several countries most notably the us india and brazil. it is a fact that data analytics and ai are the big guns of our artillery in this fight against the covid nineteen pandemic. it has helped us in several stages of this outbreak like the detection of its first outbreak vaccine development and manufacturing contact tracing and future hotspot detection. some of these interesting applications are discussed in this article. a lesser known fact is that the covid nineteen outbreak was first detected in toronto canada nearly seven two hundred thirty miles away from the first outbreak nine days before the who issued its warning. it was with the help of big data analytics and ai more specifically deep learnings dl a subset of machine learning application in natural language processing nlp to analyze text inputs that traced the surge of pneumonia cases in the wuhan province of china. the specialty of dl algorithms is that they mimic the brain cells called neurons and can identify patterns in big data. this dl backed software is used as inputs reports from public health organizations global airline ticketing data etc. these were used to flag unusual surges and potential spreads of infectious diseases. the next application of big data analytics and ai was in the research and development of drugs to halt covid nineteen. ai was used to analyze the protein structure of the virus findings that were significant in the progress of vaccine development. in preliminary studies it was found that it does not mutate as fast as other viruses such as hiv which means that a prophylactic vaccine is a better way to proceed rather than a therapy. but there is also some evidence supporting the fact that when we find any kind of cure for it there is a chance of the virus mutating which is what happened and major mutations have been found in the uk brazil and south africa. ai also assisted scientists in rapidly shortlisting a set of already available vaccines that could be effective against the coronavirus. another interesting application of ai can be found in the selection of the right candidates i.e. most likely to test positive for testing coronavirus in case of insufficient testing resources. this method was first exercised on greek borders and was called project eva. whenever a traveler wanted to come into greece he had to fill out a form known as passenger locator form plf at least twenty four hours prior to arrival containing information on their origin country demographics point and date of entry and the intended destination. eva then allocated testing resources according to the size of the set of passengers to be tested. after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine. the results were sent back to the program for real time learning. the question remains how eva made allocations it was found that statistically only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening. ultimately from a variety of countries and city pairs eva had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the multi armed bandit mab problem and the chosen method to solve this problem was an ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index. this algorithm identified on average one.8fivex as many asymptomatic infected travelers as random surveillance testing and up to two 4x as many during peak travel. after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine. following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process after a certain period policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location. this eva as presented above was in operation from august 6th to november onest processing around thirty eight five hundred plfs each day and testing on an average one8.five percent of households entering the country every day. above mentioned applications just show the tip of the iceberg and there is more to get into some of the other developments to watch for include the use of image recognition to identify covid based on x ray images the use of deep learning to predict the three d protein

23,60,data is the new oil has become the most important trendline of the 21st century. the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis. the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days. buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress. this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people. ai ml stats data mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing. but this is not true at all the only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into information . in academics while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference. thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners. hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions. the essential difference between these disciplines lies in their aims and the approach taken to achieve those aims. the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities. then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror yes humans are the best examples of intelligent entities. thus in the 1900s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent. mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research. after setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human level performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator. but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence. because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim. the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process. the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it. the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain. so basically this initial aim was human centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent. concurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace. with the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated. as programs were being applied to solve real life problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans. one of the best examples of this could be the chess playing program. an ai program defeated the world s best chess player garry kasparov. this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program. this leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligence as computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks. that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems. so rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself. then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems. an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem. the problem solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers. thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer. so a computer and problem solving approach were adopted. so the human centered approach and computer problem solving approach are the two main aims of ai. both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights. both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of ai in the problem solving approach there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim. consider the example of solving a math problem. there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem solving approach. let us say two math problems are given for you to solve. the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not. consider the first problem. the first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past. so there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem the answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you haven t seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems. this is one form of intelligence. consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past. then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion. this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process. this is the second kind of intelligence. for ai to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent. but the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information. ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own. that is the second type of intelligence. so the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning so the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning. that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai so this is the main difference between ai and ml. technically speaking it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed . this statement needs some elaboration. the essence of ml is related to the process of generalization and learning from past data. generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. consider how we humans recognize daily life objects. if we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a dog or a cat . it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it the answer is generalization if you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a concept of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog. so the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds. with generalization only can come real information . so we try to give computers the ability to generalize the raw data and convert it into information which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own. this is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data. statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it. so it is the study of explaining the data itself statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. descriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name descriptive statistics. it tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise. inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data. we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives. consider a simple case of cooking a soup. after completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad. depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad. similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information. for example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time consuming and costly. in these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty. that is where inferential statistics come for help. so the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with. so however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data. this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the data data is not useful at all in its raw form. consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications. these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc. the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problem due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights data mining is also referred to as knowledge discovery . that is why carly fiorina former ceo of hewlett packard once said the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight . this statement completely explains the aim of data mining so the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims. but the approaches taken in all of these fields help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields. this is the beauty of these fields,data oil important trendline 21st century reason advancements related data analysis machine learning statistics data mining data developing staggering popular buzzwords days

26,63,from what i have learned on the mobile apps development market recently it is becoming harder for an android or ios developer to find a suitable and well paying job in the market. some major reasons include the increasing supply of mobile engineers people generally stop downloading apps and many more. in this article i will go through a more detailed explanation of the recent trend mentioned above and my two cents on what mobile engineers could do to prepare themself for the upcoming challenge and the future of mobile apps. although the demand for mobile developers has not fallen sharply compared with previous years the growth rate has slowed. on the other hand owing to a great number of coding boot camps that target to bring up mobile and frontend engineers a great number of developers are flooding into the developer job market. the supply side for mobile engineers has increased rapidly in recent years raising the standards for qualified mobile engineers. the days of a mobile engineer easily getting over ten job offers are over. recode ran an article in mid two thousand sixteen that begins the mobile app boom kicked off in july two thousand eight when apple introduced the app store. now it is over. according to data gathered and analyzed by the cakeresume team javascript and python are now the most in demand programming languages for companies who post product development jobs on cakeresume both together taking up almost half of the job opportunities while mobile engineers taking up merely ten percent of the job opportunities. while app usage continues to grow and revenue also ascends the majority of consumers actually download zero apps per month let s face the truth born and raised up in the era of the information explosion individuals don t have the leisure to check on what s new on the app store every day. when it comes to choosing an app to download many people feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. take the productivity category of the app store as an example there are over thousands of apps in this category and new apps popping up almost every week. it is almost impossible for users to dig through and learn all the apps. they just choose what is on top then click install. and not to mention that if you could build an awesome productivity app google and apple could do it ten times better and faster than you. in the end there s not as much need for individual apps to accomplish similar convenience factors. although the bull run for mobile development has ended there are still over two billion smartphone users two7.five billion mobile apps downloaded and time spent per day on mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years. moreover apps offer a user experience that even responsive websites are unable to provide. in order to stay on top of the game you will have to differentiate yourself from the pack other mobile engineers. if you are a mobile engineer who only knows how to code and tweak your app s ui you aren t that different from others after all. below i listed a few ways that you could implement so that you could stay competitive in the job market. if you are an android developer you could start choosing a job involving kotlin or flutter which are backed by google. if you are an ios developer try to look for a job to get involved with using swift. although older mobile coding languages such as java and objective c still have their upsides the main reason why kotlin and swift are created at first is to address the older languages issue. it means that kotlin and swift provide many safety mechanisms available out of the box while being more concise and expressive than java and objective c at the same time. this point is especially crucial. each industry has its specific skills to learn and refine. for example if you are building a stock foreign exchange future or options market app you will have to understand the websocket protocol which lets you transfer as much data as you like without incurring the overhead associated with traditional http requests. for the streaming media industry possessing experience with live streaming protocols such as hls rtmp webrtc will be a must to deal with streaming related apps. these industry skills can really make you stand out and adds another layer of expertise to your already pretty impressive mobile engineer title making you more valuable in the job market. the future of mobile app development will be shaped by how businesses harness mobile technology to solve people s everyday problems. don t try to fight the irresistible trend see how you can surf the trend exposing yourself or trying to get a job in the field mentioned below will absolutely give you more opportunities as a mobile developer.,learned mobile apps development market recently android ios developer find suitable paying job market reasons include increasing supply mobile engineers people generally stop

27,64,ai allows those in training to go through naturalistic simulations in a way that simple computer driven algorithms cannot. the advent of natural speech and the ability of an ai computer to draw instantly on a large database of scenarios means the response to questions decisions or advice from a trainee can challenge in a way that humans cannot in health and medicine wearable health trackers like those from fitbit apple garmin and others monitor health rate and activity levels. they can send alerts to the user to get more exercise and can share this information with doctors. machine learning algorithms can process unimaginable amounts of information in the blink of an eye and provide more precision than humans in spotting even the smallest detail in medical imaging. a few of them are blackford zebra enlitic lunit. the company zebra medical vision developed a new platform called profound which analyzes all types of medical imaging reports that are able to find every sign of potential conditions such as osteoporosis aortic aneurysms and many more with a ninety percent accuracy rate. for eg the digital health firm healthtap developed dr. ai and apps like babylon in the uk use ai to give medical consultations based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. users report their symptoms into the app which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illness and asks patients to specify symptoms to triage whether they should go to the ed urgent care or a primary care doctor. ai robot assisted surgery robots have been used in medicine for more than thirty years. surgical robots can either aid a human surgeon or execute operations by themselves. they re also used in hospitals and labs for repetitive tasks in rehabilitation physical therapy and in support of those with long term conditions. health chatbots such as babylon ada and mostly close ended communications. microsoft predictive analysis in vision care google clinical decision support in breast cancer diagnosis ibm watson precision medicine in population health management actionable medical insights an ever increasing amount of medical data are being digitized at all public and private healthcare institutions. however by its very nature this kind of data is messy and unstructured. unlike other types of business data where traditional statistical methods can be used for quick insights patient data is not particularly amenable to simple modeling and analytics tools. for eg. enlitic a san francisco based start up has a mission of mixing intelligence with empathy and leverage the power of ai in health and medicine for precisely generating. therefore a massive parallel effort to rationalize the legal and policy making is needed to bring the full benefit of advancement in ai technologies into the healthcare space. as technologies and ai ml enthusiasts we can only hope for such a bright future where the power of this intelligence.,training naturalistic simulations simple computer driven algorithms advent natural speech ability computer draw instantly database scenarios response questions decisions advice trainee challenge humans health medicine wearable health trackers fitbit garmin monitor health rate activity levels send alerts user exercise share information doctors machine learning algorithms process unimaginable amounts information blink eye provide precision humans spotting smallest detail medical imaging zebra enlitic lunit company zebra medical vision developed platform called profound analyzes types medical imaging reports find sign potential conditions osteoporosis aortic aneurysms percent accuracy rate digital health firm healthtap developed dr apps babylon uk give medical consultations based personal medical history common medical knowledge users report symptoms app speech recognition compare database illness asks patients symptoms triage urgent care primary care robot assisted surgery robots medicine years surgical robots aid human surgeon execute operations hospitals labs repetitive tasks rehabilitation physical therapy support term conditions health chatbots babylon ended communications microsoft predictive analysis vision care google clinical decision support breast cancer diagnosis ibm precision medicine population health management actionable medical insights increasing amount medical data digitized public private healthcare institutions nature kind data messy unstructured unlike types business data traditional statistical methods insights patient data amenable simple modeling analytics tools enlitic based start mission mixing intelligence empathy leverage health medicine precisely generating massive parallel effort rationalize legal policy making needed bring full benefit advancement technologies healthcare space technologies ml enthusiasts future intelligence
28,65,in today s world telemedicine technology is one of those technologies which has brought about a change. compared to the early days there have been remarkable differences in the methods of consultation with a doctor. in the years that have passed by consultation for a disease with a doctor was quite hectic. it involved waiting traveling etc. but with the advent of telemedicine opportunities this has completely changed. it is a rural area that has been completely blessed with the invention of telemedicine. today a considerable amount of people are able to consult doctors remotely. not just doctors but specialists in various fields of medicine. this has been of great importance as far as rural people are concerned. there are a lot of telemedicine tools that have been found. there are a lot of areas like ophthalmology oncology dermatology etc where the facility of telemedicine has been practiced. most of the patients are truly benefitting from telemedicine. patients are pretty satisfied with the consultation they are getting. they don t have to travel now. they can consult doctors and other specialists from remote areas. the cost of consultation has become pretty much affordable. moreover they get exposed to highly efficient and qualified experts in the field of medicine. on the other hand there can be patients who do not fully get satisfied through a virtual consultation. rather they might feel that they need to have a direct talk with the doctor which can boost up their confidence and also it helps to maintain a better relationship with the doctor and patient. the patients feel trust when they talk to doctors face to face. moreover doctors also might be able to console their patients when they have direct interaction with their patients. there could also be patients who doubt if these virtual methodologies are really trusted worthy or not. it is so because while the patients have direct contact with their patients the qualifications are visible to the patients. so there shall be no question of distrust. there are major challenges like better connectivity of the internet without which the patients will not be able to have continuous interaction with the doctors. technical glitches may hinder the consultation too. moreover emergency situations cannot be addressed beyond a limit through telemedicine.,today world telemedicine technology technologies brought change compared days remarkable differences methods consultation years passed consultation disease hectic involved waiting traveling advent telemedicine opportunities completely changed rural area completely blessed invention telemedicine today considerable amount people consult doctors remotely doctors specialists medicine great importance rural people concerned lot telemedicine tools found lot areas ophthalmology oncology dermatology facility telemedicine practiced patients benefitting telemedicine patients pretty satisfied consultation travel consult doctors specialists remote areas cost consultation pretty affordable exposed highly efficient qualified experts medicine patients fully satisfied virtual consultation feel direct talk boost confidence helps maintain relationship patient patients feel trust talk doctors face face doctors console patients direct interaction patients patients doubt virtual methodologies trusted patients direct contact patients qualifications visible patients question distrust challenges connectivity internet patients continuous interaction doctors technical glitches hinder consultation emergency situations addressed limit telemedicine

30,67,in this era everyone is busy in his life. no one spares time for someone. so robots tackle life loneliness we have no time to stand and stare. this causes loneliness. loneliness is due to fast moving life and hurry and worry. in the 21st century everyone is spending most of their time earning money. they are day by day transforming into money earning machines. due to his perception we are losing our relations as we can t give enough time to our families. they are busy earning their livelihood. they never get satisfies and always want more. everyone is in a race of earning and then sends his children far away from himself to make them well settled in order to maintain their status. but one faces the consequences of this kind of lifestyle in his old age. people usually don t spend time with their children when their children are in their childhood but they yearn for the company of their children in their old age. they feel lonely but have none to talk with. they are still attached to people places belongings and memorable events from the past although they understand that life cannot continue the same way as earlier and this may easily result in feelings of loneliness and social isolation. as they become older they need to be attended to in order to meet their daily needs. robots can indeed serve the purpose but they can aid only mechanical care. they are just emotionless feeling fewer entities. robots aren t creative. they can work only according to a pre programmed system and till now no such software has been created that can transfer human feelings into robots. this is the major loophole of using robots to tackle late life loneliness. they can undoubtedly serve their masters but their masters can t share their feelings with them as they are incapable to understand or react to them. they can t change their activity according to the occasion. they can provide anything except emotional satisfaction and without emotional gratification loneliness can t be tackled. a master can be attached to his robot but that attachment is only due to their service. they can t share their thoughts with them. in this era we are rendered lonely and in late life feel the need for a companion with whom we can talk. we feel a need for someone who can listen to us react and advise us to tackle our day to day life problems. but we can t find one. we have undoubtedly achieved great progress in terms of technology but we can never fill the void in the heart of a person struggling with his late life loneliness with our advancements. we are in a kind of mental trance in which we experience fame progress wealth etc. but when we gain our consciousness we find ourselves lonely in this world. relations in life are actual wealth in a person s life. we can never enjoy such a bond with a robot. it will follow our commands take our appropriate care but can t react to our emotions. it can t console us. when a man lives in loneliness for a long time it eats up his conscience and transforms him into a machine. robots can never become our friends crack jokes weep our tears or establish an emotional connection with us. they can t understand our feelings. many people go into depression. depression or the occurrence of depressive symptoms is a prominent condition amongst older people with a significant impact on their well being and quality of life. they remain sick and loneliness directly impacts longevity. lonely people often think that they are no longer needed in this world and thus they want to die. it impacts their mental psychological social and physical health. robots prove to be useless in these matters. they can provide motivation only if they have the software to do so but can t themselves react to such a situation. they don t know about anger happiness or sadness. they don t themselves bring food when their master is hungry until commanded to do so. they can t even offer a glass of water themselves. a man living without relations and without fellow feeling no longer remains a human being. he becomes none less than a machine as due to his loneliness he becomes mentally ill and goes into a condition like trauma where he no longer enjoys nature s blessings becomes happy or sad as he loses the ability to react and hence can t act. it s a dangerous situation. we face a plethora of challenges in assisted living facilities such as not being addressed to emotional needs being neglected and forcing a withdrawal from social activities. relations in life interaction with fellow beings sharing of joy and happiness and fellow feeling make a man from mere a being to a social being and finally a human being.,busy life spares time robots tackle life loneliness time stand stare loneliness loneliness due moving life

32,69,management acts as a guide to a group of people working in the organization and coordinating their efforts towards the attainment of the common objective.management challenges for future digitalization of healthcare services in the current day and age a wave of digitization has taken over the world. all the emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and others are helping people live better and easier life. the service sector has also benefited a lot from digitization. it got further boost when prime minister narendra modi in the year two thousand fifteen launched a campaign known as digital india. among the various industries in the service sector digitization has had a massive impact on the operation of the healthcare and diagnostic industry. it has helped in the development of this industry and enhances life for millions of people. the condition of india in terms of healthcare has been quite grim. patients who need attention are neglected and are unable to avail proper treatment or diagnosis. however with the coming up of digitization there has been hoped for this industry also. according to dr. keshab panda ceo md l t technology services this is a model of healthcare where doctors and hospitals are paid based on patient health outcomes. the coming up of digital tools in this segment of healthcare can be considered as the starting tool. dr. panda further says that the implementation of advanced digital technologies in patient care domains like mobile health apps telehealth wearables and remote monitoring can help in enhancing accessibility boost efficiency and augment the effectiveness of treatment and preventive care. the healthcare industry over the past few decades has changed drastically. with the coming of emerging technologies new surgical procedures and medical devices have been made available. while talking about connectivity in healthcare dr. panda said that with digitization taking over the industry it is only a matter of time when with the help of the internet and smartphones digital healthcare will be everywhere. the internet for once has helped doctors connect to their patients and also with one another. this has helped in enhancing the doctor patient engagement by increasing their interaction time. big data aggregates information about a business through formats such as social media ecommerce online transactions and financial transactions and identifies patterns and trends for future use. although ransomware data breaches and other cybersecurity concerns are nothing new to the healthcare industry the two thousand twenty covid nineteen pandemic revealed just how vulnerable sensitive patient health information really is. the recent growth of digital health initiatives like telehealth doctor visits is a major contributor to the severe increase in breached patient records. as more healthcare functions continue to move online over the next year it s extremely important to ensure these processes are protected from outside threats. medical practices are citing patient collections as their top revenue cycle management struggle as patients are becoming responsible for a larger portion of their medical bills. in order to help encourage patients to submit payments in a timely manner providers must adhere to patient payment preferences. to meet patient expectations and improve the user experience ensure billing statements are patient friendly. you should offer paperless statements and a variety of payment options e.g. credit card etc. via an online patient portal and utilize the latest payment technologies such as mobile and text to pay. new features like text or email reminders help effectively communicate with patients and encourage them to pay their financial obligations. the medical insurance landscape has experienced some significant changes in recent years. as more patients are responsible for a larger portion of their healthcare bill they naturally demand better services from their providers. healthcare organizations will face tougher competition in attracting and retaining patients who demand an experience that matches the level of customer service they expect from other consumer brands. they demand a streamlined patient experience so they can self service to resolve most questions issues or concerns e.g. downloading an immunization record booking an appointment paying their bills or checking their account insurance status whenever wherever and however is most convenient for them.,management acts guide group people

34,71,imagine yourself as a being who can speak but no one can comprehend you. you are kept in captivity in a place where you can hardly breathe. you are finally selected and taken out of that place it is a happy moment for you. you can finally have your freedom but sadly instead of being free you are prodded by rods and fed toxic substances against your will. the only thing you can do is scream in vain. your voice is heard by everyone but it gets lost in the noise of scientific advancement. you writhe in pain as the substances take effect on your body the pain slowly creeps into your body and you slowly succumb to it never to wake up again. since the time of aristotle animals have been subjected to various inhumane experiments for the sake of knowledge. these experiments though unethical were very necessary for the advancement of science. animal testing has become an important part of experimenting on living organisms to ensure that a product is safe for humans to consume. the lab animals are generally subjected to high levels of toxicity while being kept in isolation due to which they have to suffer a lot of stress and discomfort. animal testing has a large number of drawbacks all of these things make us question ourselves. is it even worth it is it possible to stop this cruelty without hampering our growth with the advancement in science it can be made possible that we don t have to use animals ever again. these bio printed models can also be used by the researchers to conduct experiments on them without using animals for it. a french company is working on a bio printed liver model to test liver toxicity without having to use animals at all. this is a breakthrough in the field of bio technology as it can bring down animal experimentation by a large percentage. these alternatives can help in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent. if science can progress without harming animals then we should go for it rather than putting them through excruciating pain. we must protect the animals as much as we can or else we would soon be living in a world without them.,imagine speak comprehend captivity breathe finally selected happy moment finally freedom sadly prodded rods fed toxic substances thing scream vain voice lost noise scientific advancement writhe pain substances effect body pain slowly creeps body slowly succumb wake time aristotle animals subjected inhumane experiments sake knowledge experiments unethical advancement science animal testing important part experimenting living organisms ensure product safe humans consume lab animals generally subjected levels toxicity isolation due suffer lot stress discomfort animal testing number drawbacks things make question stop cruelty hampering growth advancement science made animals bio printed models researchers conduct experiments animals company working bio printed liver model test liver toxicity animals breakthrough bio technology bring animal experimentation percentage alternatives bringing animal experimentation extent science progress harming animals putting excruciating pain protect animals living world
35,72,introduction the definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries hence it is given the title of the most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives . an idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception. the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isn t observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically. the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete it doesn t include what it feels to be the subject for the subject. there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness. as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions consciousness is both universal and primal. whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research hasn t been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences. history beginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness. as a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain. the ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness its purpose and its worldly association with mankind. since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution. the incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too. john locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances. he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one. karl marx another early thinker denies the mind body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of one s settings. william james an american psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts. while the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 19fiftys. in sigmund freud s psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for one s behavior and thinking. he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts the id the ego and the superego. the id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle. the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy. finally the superego is an internalization of society s moral standards and responsible for guilt. now the id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious. freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and didn t conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unanswered. sigmund freud s theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people. sigmund freud s work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth character memory sexuality and therapy. however his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life. whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments sigmund freud didn t provide any evidence to support his claims. brain today the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally. issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs. a greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters. however to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousness. hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness. a few brain imaging strategies for example eeg and mri scans have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations. a few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isn t adequate to create consciousness it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus. higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functions. one mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness. analysts can record mind waves or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum using an electroencephalograph eeg and placing electrodes on the scalp. the four types of brain waves alpha beta theta and delta each correspond with one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleep memory episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory. this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past. the hippocampus located in the brain s temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory. consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions. one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of. furthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness. working memory operates maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks. the current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution or scope. examples of such methods are pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etc. pet and fmri have temporal resolution problems eeg is well known to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons that is they are restricted in scope. hence huge numbers of our speculations while testable on a fundamental level appear to be difficult to test as of now. mental illness consciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them. experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems for example agnosia a failure to decipher visual data alzheimer s disease and autism. however we actually don t comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object. several different disorders of consciousness include locked in syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma and brain death. locked in syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma is a condition wherein a patient is aware however can t move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting. the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements. in a minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness. patients need to give restricted however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance. this could be following straightforward orders comprehensible speech or purposeful conduct. in a persistent vegetative state the patient has sleep wake cycles but lacks awareness is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and non purposeful behavior. the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse like coma chronic coma results generally from cortical or white matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury or from central brainstem sores. usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to fifty seventy percent of the normal range. the patient lies with eyes shut and doesn t know about self or environmental factors. brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity and function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life . the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation. after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness sleep wake cycles or behavior and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state. future predictions and conclusion as we can see from the history of scholar s endeavors to study consciousness empirically its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods. in the past psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics. in the battle between realists and illusionists taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesn t allow for concrete evidence. as we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus. similarly even though consciousness plays a major role in memory we currently lack the facilities to research it fully. in the future there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities however which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well. not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand. as it seems researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic we will be able to answer one of psychology s most difficult questions.,introduction definition consciousness controversial centuries

36,73,nature has blessed humanity with earth a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human. though in this 21st century building space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise now with the inclusion of start ups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true. we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much needed area for our survival. with time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age. be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for. all this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1ninenine0s this idea didn t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for. but things change with the entry of paypal s owner elon musk in two thousand two where he laid stones of space x with nasa providing the launchpad for their exploration. being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing here one has to realize the optimum. but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology. thus this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far fetched though. now being in two thousand twenty we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too. proper planning analysing organising and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by two thousand twenty two and would able to colonize by two thousand fifty for achieving these vision they have planned a total of thirty six times pre launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by two thousand twenty. not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of dollar twenty two billion yearly by two thousand twenty five. already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet. with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space. but the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust. aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about dollar ten trillian which is more than many countries gdp. placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough. elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights. also our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less. whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish. because in the end we do not satisfy what we have achieved we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that. in order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage. as of now we have searched nine planets but still didn t shortlisted the outcomes. but according to the three decade theory of elon musk it seems to be possible. as the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment whether is this suitable or not and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen. the missions are now what everyone is focusing about. finding the source of water because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive. apart from the excitement and the things the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that. so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated. after the basic things other factors like what are the natural habitats available there whether the plants could be grown over there or not. if yes then what types of plants could survive there. the environment for the animals is safe or not. because to balance the nature we need all types of animals natural habitat even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance. for e.g. ants are among the leading predators of other insects helping to keep pest populations low. ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground. they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter. so every small thing contributes in its own way. another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement. because as the current scenario we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics. so the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed. and apart from this the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level. because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long. so in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done. when thinking about disease you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics such as penicillin which help fight infections may eventually stop working. global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics especially for conditions that aren t serious. this is because their overuse in recent years means that they re becoming less effective. but still we can survive without antibiotics. because there are ways of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin. it might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base. some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon. in some ways the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space station. although it hasn t been formally tested some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut s body when on the moon could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space station. by using the moon s indigenous material space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon s surface. once on the moon instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite. on earth we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere. but out in the space we can t rely on this type of protection and in order to make that protection it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve. although till now the approximate value of the project is dollar ten trillion. but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare. as once we are comfortable with all the resources securities for uncertainties risk analysis and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration then development won t take much time. because to construct a building it take normally eight nine months. which is totally acceptable. but the main concern is the density of the land i.e. whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not. and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor. although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology. in order to transport the equipments on the regular basis a large amount of fuel is required and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of colonizing at outer space.,nature blessed humanity earth rounded globe essential necessity lies human 21st century building space shuttle

37,74,we ve really done it this year. like an insatiable glutton the law of averages has come home to roost. we should ve taken the hint when on the onest of january sixty six people lost their lives in the jakarta floods. what followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise a volcanic eruption in the philippines irrepressible bushfires in australia earthquakes in russia iran turkey india and china. and speaking of china. two thousand twenty has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus. as global covid nineteen deaths stoutly push past the grim one million marks we have no choice but to question our place in the universe are we the all conquering masters of our domain or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem is the human race on the ubiquitous three part literary arc that defines every story every life every civilization ascent apex and descent maybe when michael jackson unveiled his moonwalk in nineteeneight3 or when barack obama stepped into the white house as president of the united states in two thousand eight or indeed when ms dhoni lifted the cricket world cup in two0oneone we peaked as a species and everything since then has been a steady unraveling. five hundred years is a long time. for context the world population in onefive hundred ad was a mere 46one million. the one6 fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg. though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies we might just have crossed the threshold the population projections for the year two thousand fifty is nine.eight billion and for twoone00 is a whopping oneone.two billionone. somewhere out there malthus is cackling in his grave. the year twofive hundred suddenly seems a long way off and this conversation seems ever more pertinent today. the bulletin of atomic scientists is not optimistic the famed doomsday clock they maintain is the closest to midnight our proximity to global catastrophe since its inception in nineteen47. global warming check. the threat of nuclear war check. ongoing pandemic check check check. and yet hope floats for three reasons. mankind may just have its back to the wall right now but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to twofive hundred ad the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies artificial intelligence bio enhancement genetic engineering the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming and good old fashioned human resilience. while the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on our long demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature the universe or our own self destructive tendency throws our way. the next superman in the one3th century in the italian town of pisa an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses for a local friar with weakening eyesighttwo. all of a sudden there existed an external device that could amplify our senses a tool that gave us an advantage in survival. today lasik surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely. hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds. the iphone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us. but the real science starts where the imagination ends augmented reality glasses smart wearables and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades. but what after that science has the answer and it s both thrilling and scary. artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable the filler for all questions left unanswered. but ai combined with bio enhancement and genetic engineering might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling homo nouveau3. homo nouveau will be smarter faster more agile and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is vuca beyond our imaginations. what might such a human being look like they might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception. what does that mean it means that they would be able to see better focuses their attention for longer hears what they want to hear and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body. through a chemical in the blood this ai chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body. bio augmentation of limbs and organs internal and external would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth but can simply be bought. all of a sudden the average joe can run faster than usain bolt swim better than michael phelps and fly maybe. genetic engineering will be the missing link. already there are feverish conversations about a dystopian future featuring designer babies and a digital divide that simply cannot be overcome because it is inbuilt into one s dna. the breakthrough with crispr casnine might just be the key to unlock the mysteries of dna manipulation. so what if there s no food left our body ai will adjust our appetite accordingly. no water absorb humidity from the air through specialized pores in the skin. the human being in twofive hundred ad may not be how we recognize one today. that may be our only shot. galactic dominance spacex led by its mercurial leader elon musk has been the leader here. the spacex mars programme is based on a very simple premise as the earth s closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions mars would be our best bet for colonization. musk has invested billions of dollars in the mars space programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept. and among tech visionaries musk is not alone. jeff bezos the richest man in the world owns blue origin which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth. bezos who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever expanding behemoth is not a man who thinks small. with more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet. and when the pull factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll. it might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home if not on mars then on one of saturn s moons. a human colony on mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction but so did a permanent station in antarctica until a few decades ago. mount everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak. today hundreds of people every year attempt the climb. as spaceflight becomes more reasonable as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment we become closer to our best chance of survival leaving planet earth behind and finding another home perhaps one more forgiving of our follies. the human spirit the introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community this year. and yet we survive. businesses surge ahead people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing the world goes on. earthquakes tsunamis pandemics we ve seen them all before and survived and the human race in its intrepid exploration of the world pushes onward and upward. technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see and then invest money in their vision. gradually what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real the moon landing is the best possible example of that. google launched google glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear. while the product didn t quite catch on that doesn t mean other companies aren t trying. bio augmentation is already a fast developing industry while crispr casnine the genetic scissors is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks. how long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity the human spirit the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs will eventually win. the human race will survive to twofive hundred of that there is no doubt. the real question is will the person who exists in twofive hundred with bionic chips and a bio enhanced body structure and a modified genetic code be called a homo sapien or is homo nouveau the way forward,ve insatiable glutton averages home

38,75,mr. sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan. bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container. he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis. people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork. but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist. his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling. his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art. he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers. soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy. after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy. he was not satisfied. something is eating up his mind day by day. he could not understand what s the reason behind his remorse. a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution. it is the real life embodiment of customer engagement. every business needs this feature will be an understatement. because customer engagement is the base of any business. the chatbot does the exact thing digitally. it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations. mr. sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now. and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years. the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot. though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to. he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does. he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness. he has done all that at affordable prices in no time. let s understand the mr. sakamoto s mondai nai perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems. this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr. sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place. his stories are embedded with each art. the product which he sells needs this story to be with it. his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them. we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and business owner whether the business is small medium or large. millennials a word that was not introduced before one thousand nine hundred ninety. the generation which is stuck in between gen x and gen y. a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture. they are the most targeted audience in this era. what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot it s easy less time consuming to use. mr. sakamoto is now one of the few gen x persons who can do business with the millennial so easily. mr. sakamoto has some employees and apprentices. he has trained them as per his needs. but there is a limit. they can t deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does. neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions. not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too. is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability. a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it. for mr. sakamoto s customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world. mr. sakamoto wouldn t be happier for this feature. in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language. it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world. and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says arigato but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy. handling a lot of customers is really hard. he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast. so in the competition of the market mr. sakamoto took the help of a chatbot. now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do. his business is growing exponentially. now when you found out why mr. sakamoto is happy and his business is growing in this competitive industry then do you still have a question in mind that why does your business need a chatbot,mr sakamoto bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto bonsai form cultivation trees medium container business years loves basis people

39,76,have you ever wondered what s common between sir alex ferguson pep guardiola and jose mourinho i know it might look a lame question especially to the ardent football followers. at first instinct the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe. uclwinners. but when given a closer look these managers weren t that great when it came to their careers as football players. any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who don t have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager. but is this restricted just to football mike brearley one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy wasn t the prolific batsman of his time. our former president a p j abdul kalam didn t have a political background but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had. so can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fields let s understand the leadership role types of leaders and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion. let s start by first understanding what or who is a leader. a leader is not a position or a designation. it s a virtue if employed correctly. from a janitor to the ceo from a student to a researcher from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader. leadersareeverywhere so what are the virtues of a leader one of the famous personality trait theories the big five personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership. as per the various researches the personality traits of extraversion openness and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits. not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders. but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader. notsotechnical as stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible. it sart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing arranging managing and directing the scenes. another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the baton stick to set the rhythm of the band. so is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist no. when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that he she can utilize it in the best possible way. they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts. and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person experience. every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure. even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields their visionary outlook their management skills and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets. leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties. as per the great man situational and trait theory of leadership leadership is innate to the person. leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision. everyone knows how to read a map but which path to choose isn t something that can be taught. leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve. leadership theories don t focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders but rather more on people skills their approach towards a problem and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katz. though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas but these leaders are generally at the middle management level. as per the different leadership styles a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team. these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people first mindset a collaborative approach towards solving the problem. these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom most level. since the managers at the top of the pyramid don t get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done. consider an it firm. so as per the points mentioned above does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldn t know how to code depends. if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project s kpis. the project manager who might be an operations manager mba from an it background probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client s perspective. the ceo might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the code. but in today s competitive world leaders can t be one dimensional. they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top. mike brearley if got a chance to play a t20 match won t even get picked into aside not because of his age but because of his not so great looking batting statistics thegamehaschanged . his leadership skills won t be enough to get him into the squad. but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 1five captains in the world today. as we have already discussed the film directors their job isn t to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate lens settings etc the camera. their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured. so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field but if he or she has the right approach and mindset understands the system and its process then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent with his or her vision. so the answer to the question which we came across in the first paragraph is yes and no. depending upon the position in the hierarchy yes for a front line manager and no for a cxo and the type of the leader you are the level of technical expertise needed varies. though as stated earlier by robert katz the cxo s need to have the least amount of technical expertise the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications. what processes are to be followed to build the technology. he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done itsnothowitswhat . otherwise even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader isn t aware of that or isn t learned enough to know what to do with it no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal. leaders command respect and don t demand it and that s possible when they give value to their front line employees seek timely advice from the technical experts and put the resources to the best of its uses. otherwise you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts. dilbert,wondered common sir pep guardiola mourinho lame question ardent football

40,77,the word leadership can bring to mind a variety of images. for example a political leader pursuing a passionate personal cause or an executive developing his her company s strategy to beat the competition. leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. they set direction build an inspiring vision and create something new. leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to win as a team or an organization and it is dynamic exciting and inspiring. in my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it s required a lot of skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing. a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others effective oral and written communication critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task. good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader. they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve. they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone. though all these skills we have but it s would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain. for example like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well. hence to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it. that s why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization. every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field. so be a leader not a boss which makes your life much better as they re a saying that a good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better.,leadership bring mind variety images political leader pursuing passionate personal executive developing company strategy beat competition leaders things set direction build inspiring vision create leadership mapping win team organization dynamic exciting inspiring point view leader technical expertise task organization required lot skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic motivating inspiring industrious critical thinking basis leader ability motivate effective oral written communication critical thinking skills working team delegating task leaders abilities wanted create future leader volume information essential elements define problem solve organize team solve problems communicate group established trust group trust team accomplish work skills sufficient make great leader excel utilize abilities practice lot technical expertise domain hospital hospital lead people hospital worse point lead understand scenario mechanism hospital functioning understand staff patient lead hospital deserved lead understand scenario leader requires technical expertise great knowledge understanding organization leader technical expertise organization organization run smoothly run organization technical expertise leader makes life objective leadership poorly
41,78,when we talk about ai different people have different perspectives about it. there is one group of people having good knowledge about the real potential of ai who believe that ai can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today. there is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of ai taking over the world. the field of ai took birth when alan turing in one thousand nine hundred fifty had this thought can machines think . later in the one980s with the adoption of expert systems by the companies around the world the booming of the field of ai was initiated. initially it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what ai can achieve. ai s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live work and solve challenges. ai has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare education business and many more. but one of the areas of highest impact that ai has made recently is in the environment and climate change. is ai revolutionizing the way we deal with environment and climate change ai can strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision making for decarbonising industries from building to transport and work out how to allocate renewable energy. in recent years ai has been a game changer in how many people as well as organizations deal with climate change. microsoft believes that artificial intelligence often encompassing machine learning and deep learning is a game changer for climate change and environmental issues. the company s ai for earth program has committed dollar fifty million over five years to create and test new applications for ai. ai is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well. wind companies are using ai to get each turbine s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real time weather and operational data. ai can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the internet of things the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects enabling them to send and receive data to forecast energy demand. besides artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. one vision for a sustainable city is to create an urban dashboard consisting of real time data on energy and water use and availability traffic and weather to make cities more energy efficient and livable. hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well. data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture soil composition and temperature help ai improve production and know when crops need watering. incorporating this information with that from drones which are also used to monitor conditions can help increasingly automatic ai systems know the best times to plant spray and harvest crops and when to head off diseases and other problems. this will result in increased efficiency enhanced yields and lower use of water fertilizer and pesticides. but is ai as good as it looks or does it have a downside when we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate both sides of the coin must be elucidated. so apart from all the positives discussed above the usage of ai also has a downside. last year s world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earth s environmental challenges it is important to manage it properly. according to the forum and experts in the field ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation. the use of power intensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c02 emissions. although ai has been around for about half a century the question of environmental impact and other ethical issues is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power. for all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence from speech recognition to self driving cars ai systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate changing carbon emissions. a study last year found that training an off the shelf ai language processing system produced one four hundred pounds of emissions about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between new york and san francisco. but there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener a movement that has been called green ai. some algorithms are less power hungry than others for example and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources. the key however is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced. what can be done to prevent this the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in safe ai should be pursued to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment. specifically the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension. this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable among other factors. in a sense all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind. in the future development of ai programs it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place. according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment. nearly three hundred kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model. this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states. considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial moving forward. there is always room for improvement some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called tackling climate change with machine learning was discussed at a major ai conference. david rolnick a postdoctoral fellow of the university of pennsylvania said call to arms which means to bring researchers together. this paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used including energy production co2 removal education solar geoengineering finance and many more. the main idea is to build more energy efficient buildings creating new low carbon materials high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources. artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth. how about better forecasting of climate change the kick start was already done by climate informatics in 20oneone which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science. it covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes paleoclimatology collecting data from ice cores climate up down scaling and its impact on us. there s a lot of uncertainty monteleoni claire monteleoni a computer science professor at the university of colorado concludes that ai ml models generally forecast for the short term. there is a significant difference when it comes to long term forecasting. the first system was developed at princeton in the one960s. all the ai ml models developed till now revolve around atmosphere oceans land cryosphere or ice. ai can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms. what about showing the effects of extreme weather we all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof but to make it more realistic montreal institute of learning algorithms mila microsoft and conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know as gans to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels atmospheric temperature air pollution and intensive storms. our goal is not to convince people climate change is real it s to get people who do believe it is real to do more about that said victor schmidt a co author of the paper and ph.d. candidate at mila the project is deployed for the people to look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change. can we track carbon emissions short answer yes. tracking of carbon emission is one of the agendas of the un. for this year two thousand twenty the un s goal is to prevent new coal plants from being built. satellite images come into picture using deep learning techniques data science researchers can analyze these high quality satellite images and track the emission. google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit s satellite imagery including gas powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution. there are countries organizations which govern co2 emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associations. ai can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular updates on emissions. it also introduces new ways to measure a plant s impact by crunching numbers of nearby infrastructure and electricity use. that s beneficial for gas powered plants that don t have the easy to measure plumes that coal powered plants have.,talk people perspectives group people

42,79,no one can reduce mistakes to zero but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. use these tips to become a more effective worrier. don t be afraid or ashamed of your fear. our culture glorifies fearlessness. the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart tough and unafraid. but fear like any emotion has an evolutionary purpose and upside. your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we re in a challenging situation. a cautious leader has value. this is especially true in times like these. so don t get caught up in ruminating i shouldn t be so fearful. don t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don t interpret it as evidence that you re an indecisive leader or not bold not visionary. if you have a natural tendency to be prevention focused channel it to be bold and visionary if you struggle to believe this identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters. use emotional agility skills. fear of mistakes can paralyze people. emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings such as i feel anxious i m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe. stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. it s like turning the light on in a dark room. next comes accepting reality. for example i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways. list off every truth you need to accept. then comes acting your values. let s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. identify your five most important values related to decision making in a crisis. then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face. repeat this process for each of your fears. it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero. focus on your processes. worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. most people don t. when you worry it should be solutions focused not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure. we can control systems not outcomes. what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes direct your worries into answering questions like these is the data you re relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences broaden your thinking. when we re scared of making a mistake our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. imagine you re out walking at night. you re worried about tripping so you keep looking down at your feet. next thing you know you ve walked into a lamp post. or imagine the person who is scared of flying. they drive everywhere even though driving is objectively more dangerous. when you open the aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most. it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. but this strategy can help kick you into problem solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they don t realize that other people care most about something else. find out what other people s priorities are. recognize the value of leisure. fear grabs us. it makes it difficult to direct our attention away. this is how it is designed to work so that we don t ignore threats. some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. they want to be on guard at their command post at all times. this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work. that type of adrenalin fueled behavior can have short term value but it can also be myopic. a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. we need leisure and sleep to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see blindspots and think creatively. get some silent time. although much maligned a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically. detach from judgment clouding noise. as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into always on monitoring mode. you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently. this can result in information overload. your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. recognize if you re doing this and limit over monitoring or over checking. avoid panicked frenzied behavior. on its own being afraid of making mistakes doesn t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels you might make do or say the wrong things. however if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well reasoned choices.,reduce mistakes learn drive prevent channel decision making tips effective worrier afraid ashamed fear culture glorifies fearlessness traditional image leader tough unafraid fear emotion evolutionary purpose upside concern making mistakes remind challenging situation cautious leader times caught ruminating shouldn fearful ashamed afraid fear making mistakes interpret evidence

43,80,what s perfection really does every person expect perfection from oneself or someone else or is it in certain amounts many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect. but how do we verify it let us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget. all are given rs. five thousand assumed to complete this task. they can t go beyond this budget. manish vinay and sameer need to make a stool for themselves each. manish has no understanding of carpentry he learns from youtube. vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool. but sameer is a carpenter so he has a total understanding of the material process and final product. let us start with manish. understand that the task is to get their jobs done. manish has two options here. he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood glue nails etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product. the only difference is his lack of expertise in this field. vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering. sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time. all three are given three days for the task. since manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders three leg parts six horizontal support bars and one circular base which will sit on the top. vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts cuboidal bars and a thick sheet. sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first day. manish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come. they begin to work on the second day. manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre made hole applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video and places weight on the assembled stool. he waits for the glue to cure. vinay uses borrowed drill bits drill machines cutters sandpapers purchased from a shop etc and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning. he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night. sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure. on the third day each of them has the stool ready. they evaluate their own work and notice certain facts. manish notices that he did complete the task but his stool was wobbly and not glued well. it could fall the moment he sits on it. also he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over youtube. vinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight. but there are minor issues with it. one of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool a tad unstable. sameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product. the stool is well balanced and polished as he expected from him. sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool perfect. manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done. he is satisfied with his work. but vinay is unhappy he could have done better and made the product better. he doesn t find his efforts well put and thinks he wasn t productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfect. understand that all of them had a set of skills and experience but only sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product. manish and sameer were satisfied and happy with their work. manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go. he thinks put the efforts and he did a good job. it was only vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfect. in vinay s case it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes. the reason is simple he put effort but didn t have the experience. experience mattered. since vinay thinks otherwise he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results. he is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect result. in this case the idea of perfection itself is misplaced. you see the end product made by vinay and manish would not match sameer s but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied. for both it was their skill. sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity others didn t. and in this story every individual put effort regardless of the result. but some were satisfied and some dissatisfied. their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasn t productive enough. perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effort . you can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately it s the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection. if you aren t satisfied you won t find anything perfect. you would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesn t suit you in the first place as explained in the story before. it isn t productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfaction . satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies. the real enemy is dissatisfaction. you get demotivated and restless. you lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation. so it s the only obstacle that comes in between productivity from time to time. productivity is far from being your enemy. the greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction. it will play a major role in crafting your idea of perfection in every day.,perfection expect perfection oneself amounts times question mind deem perfect verify understand work

44,81,the financial crisis of two thousand eight started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market i.e. in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores which ultimately led onto a huge global collapse. the financial crisis of two thousand eight or great recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the great depression. in the year one thousand nine hundred ninety six there was a dot com boom or otherwise known as the dot com bubble in the united states a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly. however around the year two thousand it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly. it led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around one percent very quickly in a short span. investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets. fig rise and fall of the dot com bubble as interest rates went lower and lower real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties. the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in i.e. in real estate . during that same time investment banks saw an opportunity chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo collateralized debt obligations and started providing it to these investors after getting a credit rating of aaa very safe investment from the credit rating agencies. investors naturally fell for it and started buying these cdos. so now the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the banks to the investment banks and then again to the cdo investors. with the high buying demand of cdos investment banks started demanding or pressurizing banks to provide even more loans so that they can provide more cdos to the investors. however banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people. but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scores.approximately dollar one74bn worth of loans were given out during the period two thousand two thousand seven and most of them were clubbed as cdos with a aaa rating from the credit rating agencies. approximately seventy percent of these cdo s were marked with a aaa rating. investment banks and credit rating agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time. moody s a credit rating agency profits increased 4x times during that period two thousand two thousand seven . looking at the huge profits being made by the investment banks and credit rating agencies insurance companies like aig now started giving out insurance on these cdos to the investors and they called it cds credit default swap . aig believed that since the cdos were rated as aaa very safe investment the failure chances of these cdos were very minimal. they misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these cdos were sub prime loans. now cdo investors started buying out cds from aig and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses. aig then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay. but they never realized the outcome if by any chance the cdos fail at some point in time. thus the risk factor again got transferred from the cdo investors to the insurance companies. fig flow diagram showing how the risk factors got transferred coming to the loan borrowers now sub prime borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of adjustable rate loans interest rate of these loans keeps changing and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on. the borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around two thousand seven and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted. added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans. almost fifty percent of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan. this led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back. with the high interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit. the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier. banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction the value of cdos ultimately came down to . some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt ex lehman brothers . moreover insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance. as a result some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt. aig too almost lost about dollar onebn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos. however the us govt. finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankrupt. cdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch became very difficult to get loans and the whole economy of the us underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world. unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down. global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally global recession hit the world.,financial crisis started crisis subprime mortgage market ie

45,82,gender diversity is an equal representation of all genders in workplaces. one of the most important sectors where there is under representation of gender diversity is the technological industry. gender diversity means you have an equal opportunity which is not limited by gender. but the true reality is gender diversity is a far outcry in the world. gender diversity isn t a new topic but an old and global phenomenon and technology industry is not a stranger to it. women are often underrepresented in the technology sector. to understand the gap let s look at some statistics. after looking at these staggering numbers we see how biased gender diversity is even in the technological sector. with rapid industrialization and education about the importance of rights gender diversity is very important in today s world. gender equality represents a society that has lesser violence and provides a safer world for everyone. it is also directly proportional to sustainable development and ensures human rights to everyone. as today s markets are increasing along with customers preferences to understand customer profiles and build products we need gender diversity in our organizations. equal representation helps in a better decision making process for a positive impact. men and women invest back into their families and having gender equality and diversity helps build values into families and households. empowering individuals not only help themselves but also the economy of the nations. gender equality and diversity should be built into organizations beliefs and values. global gender gap report two thousand seventeen perception if we see the word gender it is a socially constructed definition. and this definition changes as per different cultural norms. in a much broader term our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and non binary gender which includes queer trans and intersex individuals as well. the socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity. so when it comes to choosing their career people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness. e.g. we see more women as compared to men in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualities. there are different versions of this perception which we can see either in the society in terms of socially assigned gender roles or in the workplace in the form of gender discrimination stereotypical thinking sexism etc. . e.g. as per their assigned roles in society women are most likely to take care of their family and children and this affects their income and career growth. the motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children i.e. there is also an income difference between a mother and a non mother employee. as per oecd data two thousand twelve there is a seven percent reduction in wages for women per child. lack of economic opportunities even in the tech industry women are paid less than men. as per ilo data two thousand nineteen on average women are paid twenty percent less than men worldwide. even when it comes to promotion men are preferred more. it is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved. e.g. a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on. as per the national centre for transgender equality one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects including twenty three percent were denied a promotion forty four percent were passed over for a particular job position and twenty six percent are fired from their workplace just because they are transgender. we can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involved. for society creating tech awareness from school level as per the hdr report two thousand seventeen no. of boys pursuing stem program is 9seven percent higher than girls. one way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue. minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field. these job roles are not even gender specific anymore. for developing countries like india stem scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education level. address bias stereotypes it is to be noted that perceptions stereotypes and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these the things we watch listen and read daily. so it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment. e.g. a more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in society. there should be active encouragement from parents teachers and educators for students in stem programs regardless of their gender identity. for companies to promote gender diversity in the workplace companies need to focus on three things unbiased recruitment policies generally there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women trans intersex and queer individuals. there needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the hr itself that addresses these issues. a blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documents. having structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biases. diversity sensitivity training workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documents. conducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoun gender neutral language. not just sensitivity training strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination. to create accountability and transparency in their process companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company data. retention policies creating mentorship models including proper maternity leaves child care facilities and flexibility of working hours remote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work life balance. develop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave. it might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship support. increase pay parities it can be done in the following ways lastly there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level. it may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools irrespective of their gender identity for developing countries like india to have proper compensation policies in the workplace as similar to what states like california new york has adopted to ensure pay parity.,gender diversity equal representation genders workplaces important sectors representation gender diversity technological industry gender diversity equal opportunity limited gender reality

46,83,the covid nineteen crisis and its fallout including recession layoffs and uneven economic pain as well as recent protests over police brutality and demands for racial justice have presented many of us with challenges that we ve not encountered before. the high stakes and unfamiliar nature of these situations have left many people feeling fearful of missteps. no one can reduce mistakes to zero but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making. use these tips to become a more effective worrier. our culture glorifies fearlessness. the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart tough and unafraid. but fear like any emotion has an evolutionary purpose and upside. your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we re in a challenging situation. a cautious leader has value. this is especially true in times like these. so don t get caught up in ruminating i shouldn t be so fearful. don t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don t interpret it as evidence that you re an indecisive leader or not bold not visionary. if you have a natural tendency to be prevention focused channel it to be bold and visionary if you struggle to believe this identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters. fear of mistakes can paralyze people. emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis. this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings such as i feel anxious i m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe. stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. it s like turning the light on in a dark room. next comes accepting reality. for example i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways. list off every truth you need to accept. then comes acting your values. let s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. identify your five most important values related to decision making in a crisis. then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face. repeat this process for each of your fears. it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn t clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero. worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively. most people don t . when you worry it should be solutions focused not just perseverating on the presence of a threat. direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure. we can control systems not outcomes. what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes direct your worries into answering questions like these is the data you re relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences when we re scared of making a mistake our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario. imagine you re out walking at night. you re worried about tripping so you keep looking down at your feet. next thing you know you ve walked into a lamp post. or imagine the person who is scared of flying. they drive everywhere even though driving is objectively more dangerous. when you open the aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most. it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. but this strategy can help kick you into problem solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you. a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they don t realize that other people care most about something else. find out what other people s priorities are. fear grabs us. it makes it difficult to direct our attention away. this is how it is designed to work so that we don t ignore threats. some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance. they want to be on guard at their command post at all times. this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work. that type of adrenalin fueled behavior can have short term value but it can also be myopic. a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking. we need leisure and sleep to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see blindspots and think creatively. get some silent time. although much maligned a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically. as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into always on monitoring mode. you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently. this can result in information overload. your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down. recognize if you re doing this and limit over monitoring or overchecking. avoid panicked frenzied behavior. on its own being afraid of making mistakes doesn t make you more or less likely to make good decisions. if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels you might make do or say the wrong things. however if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well reasoned choices.,covid crisis fallout including recession

47,84,the word pandemic may be the most used word for the last decade and we know why. the year two thousand twenty comes with a lot of unprecedented threats to humans as well as to nature. while no business was left insulated from its effect small businesses were one of the most affected as they rely on day to day sales and keep the inventory minimum based on the demand of customers and have a low margin to maneuver. in an article by hsbc s navigator which described the preparedness and contingency plan for the future indian business rated high among its peers. the businesses in india have shown resilience to face adversity which can be attributed to varying degrees of adjustment and adaptability. the businesses while able to adhere to government guidelines have managed to facilitate their customers efficiently and effectively. however the impact on micro small and medium enterprises cannot be left unattended. the indian subcontinent has an estimated rupee six hundred thirty three.eighty eight lakh of msme out of which fifty one.two percent are in rural areas which employ forty four.eighty four percent of the total employment provided by this sector. the msme sector with one thousand one hundred seventy lakh people constitutes forty percent of the total workforce. as per the ministry of commerce msme contribution in gross domestic product gdp and export are thirty seven percent and forty three percent respectively. with the huge contribution toward gdp as well as export the impact on the national economy due to the shock in the msme sector from the pandemic will be equally devastating. while different businesses face different types of obstacles we have pointed out eight of the most common issues faced by them. for any business cash in hand is oxygen. the small business which usually has at most one month cash to run the business if the revenue stream dries up which in this tough time has to improve gradually. to manage the optimal cash balance is the key to success in this tough time. the optimal cash balance here defined as the less of the amount of cash outflow in form rent employee salaries and raw material without postponing the payable as they are doing what banks have to do to the inflow from sale . in any given situation business is like juggling between multiple tasks to optimize the performance while maximizing the revenue. the current situation has added another layer of challenge. this challenge will test management skills in various aspects of our business owner. with this article we have pointed out the major challenges and possible ways to alleviate the impact. as anthony robbins quotes every problem is a gift without problems we would not grow the current market has wiped out their share in the market which gives an opportunity to other businesses to grow and lower the expense. while there may be many facets that need to be handled precisely communication is one of the major tools that will create a positive environment among workers or teams which will influence the customer behavior and result in terms of revenue. the communication will also help to increase productivity and create trust in a supply chain which will improve the cash conversion cycles and working capital ratio. marketing through word of mouth has no added cost but the benefit can be scaled too much required revenue. the choice of an effective marketing tool can also influence our target customer and will influence their will to buy the product or service s strategically. cash from operating activity improves if we were able to lower our expenses. to lower these expenses small business owners have to create a different plan good average and worst keeping the six month frame in mind. breaking down them in monthly targets would further help them to identify the actual scenario and update the strategy accordingly. as warren buffet quotes you only have to do a few things right in your life so long as you don t do too

48,85,some vendors fruit and vegetable sellers began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. after a few weeks the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were being permitted to vend due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks . however the cost of doing business as well as the risk has gone up significantly with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. also with the lockdown still partially in place the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. due to the harsh summer heat perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have. the state has recently announced a stimulus package of inr five thousand crore for nearly fifty lakh vendors acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr ten for all vendors but this is not sufficient. instead of credit the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit a cash grant as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. the vendors need income support to be able to restart work and if they are not able to do so how will they return the loan. in the face of the ever changing crisis vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. to this end vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda,vendors fruit vegetable began venturing days explicit permission immediately faced police harassment government eased restrictions essential vendors permitted vend due part advocacy vendor organizations activist networks cost business risk significantly vendors access wholesale markets suppliers spend travel costs due travel restrictions lockdown partially number buyers earnings due harsh heat perishable fruits vegetables reduced shelf life vendors unable capitalize produce recently announced stimulus package inr crore lakh vendors acknowledging grave impact loss livelihood intended relief vendors credit provide initial working capital inr vendors sufficient credit government converting direct income benefit livelihood support start income activity regularly vendors income support restart work return face changing crisis vendor organizations step forward advocate vendors provided resources resume livelihoods end vendors organizations advocacy agenda
49,86,the covid nineteen pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory with growing worried about how the pandemic s catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels. given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets interruptions to specific aspects of it such as the availability of fresh vegetables could have a negative influence on population health which has already been noted as a source of worry. despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains warehouse clubs and supercenters in grocery retail vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings. fresh vegetable vendors are typically smaller and more community oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores greengrocers storefront stands street carts and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables. smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city nyc particularly in ethnic enclaves despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers. since the covid nineteen pandemic began many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states including new york city have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid nineteen. the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities. furthermore these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices. these fresh vegetable vendors unlike larger well established grocery store vendors may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid nineteen epidemic consequently the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors. in order to assess the impact of the covid nineteen pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors surveillance data from both before and after the pandemic s inception is required. after a few days vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police. after a few weeks the government relaxed the limitations allowing vital traders to sell their wares due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks . however the cost of doing business has increased dramatically as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city imposed travel limitations. furthermore with the partial lockdown still in place the number of buyers has decreased as have earnings. perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have. consider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid nineteen. the state has launched an inr five thousand crore stimulus package for over fifty lakh vendors realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood. the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr ten but this will not be enough. instead of credit the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit such as a cash grant to help people start earning money on a regular basis. the vendors require income support in order to resume work and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods. vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda finally some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic only to reopen recently. alternatively vendors may have launched soon after the in person checks were completed but still within the june july two thousand twenty endpoint timeframe. this is a drawback of the method in order to offer the most reliable covid nineteen pandemic monitoring data data must be collected in a short period of time.,covid pandemic grown socially disruptive health crises recent

50,87,as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for. the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a usually a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries innate business models. in this article we will look at the impact of covid nineteen pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply side. the aviation and tourism industries has two major customers tourists and business travellers. let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be like. almost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because of now let us look at different types of holiday revellers. tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists. according to business insider in two0nineteen almost ten million foreign tourists visited india spending over rupee one eight hundred billion during january to november period. . however because of the pandemic almost all this business has been lost. due to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel. those who do dare to venture out perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors moving our focus to domestic tourists we subdivide our population according to income levels in order to attract well paying customers the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower. most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes thus they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancing. because of covid nineteen pandemic businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls thus the movement of business personnel will be restricted. there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sector. moving over to the supply side the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain. because the industry is a leisure expense manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped. because of the drop in demand it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again. furthermore workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographies. let us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and april. the bookings vanished in mid march. property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected. the sharing economy like uber lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services interior design one time spend and property maintenance which are fixed costs. thus because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist. they have people who depend on the owner s rental income which made the problem worse. hosts usually decide cancellation policy but under extreme circumstances like this one the company decided to override all existing policies many of whom weren t strict and gave full refund to the guests. the company got dollar two billion loan and has helped out the owners financially by paying two5 percent for cancelled bookings capping at 5k host. they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction. thankfully there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans . airdna states that the listing split up for airbnb is thirty three percent list single property thirty three percent owners list two two4 properties thirty three percent hosts have two5 properties. some state governments in america have banned short term rentals. this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives could ve generated revenues. so what are hosts doing now many are discounting units and looking for long term tenants onetwo months . many are planning to apply for a small business loan seek forbearance from banks find long term tenants independently of airbnb and sell property. according to the wall street journal roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques. however it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issues. this complicates reopening because workers don t want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less. but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven and business can reopen. however money in the consumer s pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open. about forty million americans are now on unemployment benefits majorly from restaurant hospitality and retail industries. congress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really time consuming for payments to be calibrated to each worker s lost wages. their dollar six hundred federal payment corresponds to dollar one5 hours wage but twoone states follow dollar seven.two5 hours. most workers don t want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their families. workers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them. but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up. without income support low wage workers would likely seek out other jobs including side hustles and gig work which could expose them and their households to the virus. thus according to the government it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economy. studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk. combined with that in long journeys passengers may take off masks. thus the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planes. currently the airlines plan on using self cleaning material long lasting disinfectant touchless lavatories uv light as a disinfectant antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces and cleaning between flights. however even after these efforts only onetwo percent of people are flying compared to last year same time as of twoseventh may two0two0. aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus as the coronavirus pandemic spread the entire industry jolted to a halt. they are one of the hardest hit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to pre covid levels and margins have also reduced. however in with a bleak future this industry is here to stay because people have to travel and eventually they will vacation as well. coronavirus has become a survival of the fittest test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processes.,coronavirus pandemic unfolds industries face problems imagined prepared aviation tourism industries face highest stress coronavirus spreads leisure

52,89,the covid nineteen pandemic has reshaped the fundamental fabric of our world. initiating in china in late december 20nineteen the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world infecting millions in its wake. countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees. india has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries restricting the movement of people goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town. due to such stringent restrictions on movement the economy has received a fatal blow. the virus arrived in india at a time when the country was already in strife dealing with a slowing gdp growth rate and an ever increasing fiscal deficit. the lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state. other countries have also faced a similar predicament particularly in the us and europe both being hotspots for virus transmission. however upon taking a closer look at the global economy there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain. these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits. so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them if we look at the evolving it ites industry around the world the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common flexibility. these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown. be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time they haven t shied away from changing the rules of the game. let s look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown. lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes with nothing much to do of significance. as a result social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period. reportedly there has been close to a fifty percent rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook instagram and whatsapp in the hardest hit economies. twitter has reported a twenty three percent increase in its user base as compared to last year. the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation. video consumption sites such as youtube instagram and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits. it s no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns. these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape. be it rumors regarding the cure for covid nineteen gossips or rap battles these platforms provide viewers with their much needed dose of distractions. as they say ignorance is bliss . the lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data mining companies. with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have. widespread implementation of data mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for government regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times. moreover these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records. countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak. although noble such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy. the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes. this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy. cloud computing cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years. however the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services. with an increasing reliance on remote working the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical. the cloud computing services such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process. the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned. social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities. moreover a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement for the fear of transmission of the virus. e commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism. with high standards of hygiene and at home delivery these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores. other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic. recent weeks have made it evident that e commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods. online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment having only been in existence for the past couple of years. they had already however established a name for themselves before the lockdowns. sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases for a while now. now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned. this has already become evident with zee5 india reporting a whopping eighty percent increase in subscriptions and a fifty percent increase in the time spent on their site within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself. another such platform mubi reported a twenty eight percent rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced. these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms which is unlikely to change anytime soon. the idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet. not just audio or text but video conferencing is the need today. hence it s understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm. arguably the most popular of these zoom has reported a one hundred thirty percent increase in its price share since the beginning of two thousand twenty. another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite operated by microsoft has reported a whopping twelve million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us. this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online. the indian picture the indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes. according to rajesh gopinathan chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd. the work from home model of operations is here to stay. he also claimed that the firms only requires a twenty five percent workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations. tata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost ninety percent of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model and other smaller firms have followed suit. what it tells us is that we re headed in a direction we re unlikely to return from. remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon. however a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture. the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business. this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously. the lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we ve witnessed. where on the one hand the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal the unorganized sector and the msmes micro small and medium enterprises seem to be at the crux of death. the sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis. as a result of the lockdown several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive. this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge. a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves. not receiving significant support from the government these people have been initiating treks back to their villages. what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways walking weeks to find shelter and food. truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways. both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework. one i reckon won t heal anytime soon. the covid nineteen pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon. the areas that we ve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade. an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry. an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that we ve discussed. it seems to be a never ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so while the others will be washed out from our collective memory.,covid pandemic reshaped fundamental fabric world initiating late 20nineteen virus spread corner world

53,90,a video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device such as a personal computer gaming console or mobile device. video games have been in existence since the early one970s and have become increasingly popular spanning different mobile smartphones tablets and stationary computer or console platforms. advances particularly in mobile devices have given birth to social networks and group gaming although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age gender or fitness it is most popular with adolescents. in two thousand eighteen the world health organization who classified gaming disorder in their international classification of diseases icd eleven . the icd eleven is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders. it should be noted that the inclusion of gaming disorder in the icd eleven by who has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community. although recognized as an area of clinical interest the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm five published by the american psychiatric association suggests that more clinical research is required before gaming disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder. similarly the who notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in icd eleven to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior including its prevention and treatment. what is online gaming disorder two thousand eighteen who draft eleventh revision of the icd eleven denotes the disorder as a pattern of digital gaming or video gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. online gaming disorder has the same similarities with internet gaming disorder igd which is a condition that the american psychiatric association apa noted in dsm five as an area in need of additional study. the apa does not currently recognize igd as an official condition. for gaming disorder to be diagnosed the who criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal family social educational occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of twelve months. according to the who definition a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least twelve months problems controlling control their gaming habits seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident. further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety depression obesity sleeping disorders and stress. people who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity sleep disorders and other health related issues according to who one . video game related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries skin disorders and other health issues. other problems according to shoja et al. two thousand seven include a condition that could be termed video game provoked seizures in patients with pre existing epilepsy. the following health consequences of video gaming have been reported. video game playing is associated with eye problems. extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea pupil and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices. the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches dizziness and in some cases nausea and vomiting. interestingly there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention compared with non gamers. this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention. for sufferers of amblyopia dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain video games may be helpful. persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems. a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing. such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck. furthermore a case report involving a nine year old teenager referenced playstation thumb. playstation thumb is characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay. using dermoscopy dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis the loosening or separation of a fingernail in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. also tendon injuries tendinosis of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse is another health problem associated with video game playing. furthermore another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games. this condition has been termed perhaps sarcastically a wii fracture. there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games although ergonomic measures including chair to monitor position could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing. playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity. this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players. alternatively it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities such as gaming. in either case several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index bmi . it has been estimated that children in the united states spend 2five percent of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games. furthermore children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity. if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers. evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than one.five hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games were 7five.four percent less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than one.five hours engaged in the same activity. in a 20eleven study an association between video game activity and an increase of mostly junk food intake was reported. specifically single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake regardless of appetite. it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect. other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games. health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early one980s. the first medically documented case of a video game induced seizure was reported in one98one. in one993 a story in the popular press sun newspaper reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game. similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products. in one99four it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying one0 feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games. this is clearly an area in need of additional research. the cost benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years. it is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder. effective strategies include educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his her urge for video games recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity build self esteem and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions family involvement including counseling and discussion family and other relationships and developing new lifestyles. the latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well known mantra of alcoholics anonymous it s all about people places and things. to prevent the persistent playing of video games people need to explore new activities set new goals and metrics of achievements beyond video game scores.,video game software program played computing device personal computer gaming console mobile device video games existence one970s increasingly popular spanning mobile smartphones tablets

55,92,finding ways to make using the internet easier is something most modern consumers are passionate about. since the rise of ai infused technology like amazon s alexa or apple s siri voice search has grown increasingly popular. in fact nearly sixty percent of people all over the world use voice search at least once a day. as this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day business owners are starting to take notice of voice search. capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search. are you trying to make your website more voice search friendly if so check out the following tips. in the past if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology well good luck with that. but today machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy. google s voice recognition google is now able to understand human language with ninety five percent accuracy. these improvements mean that while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products services or information with increasing degrees of nuance leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery. thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results. because voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well if not better than traditional query options customer trust in them is growing yet only four percent of businesses are properly optimized for voice search. what s with the disconnect in other words business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who haven t been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use. bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind. when people use voice search they don t just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a tv. people want all kinds of other information such as your store hours how to connect to support specialists and when you re having your next sale. this is partly why some experts have predicted a totally different internet within the next five to ten years one where voice activated chatbots have all but replaced the e commerce channels we re used to using. shoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday life think life hacks and how tos. in fact words like how what best and easy are among the top voice search queries. this means that when it comes to online marketing you probably need to change your entire optimization approach taking elements like grammar and semantics the structure of your site and structured data markup that influences google s ability to find your content. of course optimizing from the start not as an afterthought is ideal. voice search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches. we can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems they also can use it at many points in the customer journey. for example about half of shoppers use voice to research products even near me searches results are mostly done by customers. customers also use voice to these statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products. voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions. a survey showed that once a consumer makes a local voice search their next most common action is to call the business twenty eight percent . customers also are highly likely to visit company websites twenty seven percent show up at the company s location nineteen percent and do more research into that business or additional businesses 1four percent and twelve percent respectively . so in short while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction you shouldn t see it as a total substitute. many people are going to take further steps after the initial search and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while. they are going to have more questions and they re willing to physically connect with you and what you offer. don t drop the ball in other areas like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate having enough staff ready to chat listing an accurate contact number or keeping your store well stocked. voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands but there s still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business s bottom line. the next step is to find voice search solutions. however as with other technologies these are not necessarily one size fits all meaning it s critical to shop around and be specific about your goals. if you can customize and update your options in a scalable way they ll be even more effective for your business.,finding ways make internet easier modern

56,93,the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined. the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be long lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors. with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work the way we interact what work we will do how the work will be done and whatnot. to just give an example in the middle of the first lockdown fmcg major hindustan unilever hul went ahead with its merger. it took place online entirely. yes it took place online. who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online change is inevitable. but some changes are temporary and some are permanent. the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent. in fact these changes were due for a long time and we re coming at a slow pace. what the pandemic has done is it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change. so what exactly the changes will be let s look at them one by one. the first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards. the zoom jio meet google meet and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held. this may be bad news for the employees who are older than forty years. they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life. experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy less. the older employees would have to work with the younger ones. there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial. the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent. there will be more egalitarianism in companies. the corporates will think much more about office space. rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight. the impact would be more prudent in small and mid sized businesses. the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses. but it s not going to be easy for companies. the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world. there would be no surprise if a lot of start ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies. also travel is going to be reduced. so the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way. the second change is going to be struck down on employees. already many of the companies and start ups are reducing the workforce. it is expected that new normal offices would work with an eighty percent workforce of that of the current workforce. automation is on the verge. due to safety reasons the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible. this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector. it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased. in the new normal tech enabled world the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers managers. the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but don t really drive the business. in the designation less set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic they automatically become redundant. for the first time the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs. also when the workforce in the company would be less in the company the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary. it is a win win situation for both employees and companies. employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain. the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this. the assessment of employees might change too. rather than going for an annual performance review the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform. creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office. the other change might be in the services sector. the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely. the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years. it also opens the opportunity for something very new. the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market. according to mckinsey the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly. there are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies. let s dig deep into this. minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more. well this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic. people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average. but it would be hard to stay the same as this. the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term. it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero. the high quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers. it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy. though this time may take some time it will surely return on track. but every trouble comes with an opportunity. this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him. but for that companies are required to follow plans formulate strategies to suit their needs and pay more attention to the innovation. the companies must form plans for the five stages from here. these stages are 5rs resolve resilience return reimagination and reform. resolve in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself. the tendency of the company should not be like that they will return only after everything becomes normal. in most parts of the country permission is granted to the companies for their operations. if they wait for normalcy then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy. resilience the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity addressing solvency and grow for sustainability. all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming. addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies. businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent. for example the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company. organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability. return in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track. given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent identify report and contain future flareups. many industries will face this problem of returning. staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi scenario modeling exercise. reverting to non covid nineteen care will require extensive planning and market testing. reimagine the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic. a small virus and the whole economy at the toss. the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much. the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days. this should become a permanent feature. cross organizational collaboration has become much easier. this should stay in the long run. reform the last phase is the reform. in this phase the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them. also the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers. the confidence in their brands they must regain it. there are three ways to shift work talent and skills to where and when they are needed most thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers. in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks. the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal. we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful. thus retaining their confidence is the utmost priority. the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers. the organizations require to create virtual offices. there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization. the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre corvid state. by breaking out of rigid job constraints the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real time. this was happening before the pandemic too. but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour. the perception that automation is a job killer is totally wrong and in fact it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis. organizations can increase automation in call centers. this will reduce the response time. temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines restaurants hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics. to conclude the companies should understand lives come first but livelihood matters . the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services but this is not the end. the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre corvid situations. the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. the last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services.,pandemic shaken world imagined impact jobs services lasting foundation

57,94,social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that it s almost hard to imagine a time without updates likes comments and shares. people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. thus it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. the phrase out of sight out of mind has never been so apt than in today s time. social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. it s why we call it social media. social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read click on and share your message in practicality it is not about a one off communication but more about the construction of a long term relationship with your target customers. hence when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand s engagement tactics. a fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as to understand the reach of social media by the use of numbers most popular social networks worldwide as of july two thousand twenty ranked by number of active users in millions how many retweets on twitter how many reactions to the post on facebook how many likes on instagram how many shares on linked in this seems to be the new age resume. thus a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. as with most online actions it s often difficult to measure offline benefits. more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day week but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. that familiarity later on might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand s personality improves visibility and becomes its voice. customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. it could range from picking and variety seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. no one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. each brand s strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell its target customers and the beliefs of the brand. some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are influencer marketing influencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. here the audience doesn t care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers. an influencer as being someone who has two thousand seventeen saw chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. since then it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers especially on instagram. cross channel marketing cross channel marketing or multi channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. because not everyone uses every single platform it s a good idea to have a presence on a few and share some of the same content across the different networks. what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. apart from using basics like facebook instagram and twitter a clever use of spotify youtube or igtv to showcase the brand can make a real difference. the luxury vehicle brand land rover s cross channel marketing includes the google display network homepage masthead and masthead in lightbox ads on youtube and visibility through mobile search and google . the brand s digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like glacier national park and the appalachian mountains and land rover s microsite. their cross channel efforts resulted in one hundred million impressions from youtube and a ten percent increase in search ad ctr. further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for fifteen percent of the brand s total sales. informative the content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products new products achievements of the brands or even casual content. there should be wow i didn t know this factor. only then will they become regular followers of the brand. an example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make up tutorials. fenty beauty is one such prime example which has built up to one.fourm followers within just four days of its launch eventually garnering close to tenm followers with rihanna being one of their icons. involving customers engaging them customer is king is a known concept. it is the foundation of traditional marketing. so while we shift to social platforms brands must not forget them. understanding their needs addressing them inviting them to respond and take part in the brand s online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key. founder and ceo of glossier emily weiss described the brand as the first socially driven beauty brand. glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term instagram brands using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. glossier often crowdsources product development asking its instagram followers what they d like to see next. dynamic the content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season festival or event that is happening. people must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it. starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. their one off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver ipa effectiveness award for its social strategy in 20one8. the launch of its now iconic unicorn frappuccino spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating instagrammable food and drink. as a result there are now five hundred fifty seven two hundred thirty two posts using the hashtag pumpkinspicelatte. product focussed now of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. so it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. in simple terms the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell. to support the product centric statement oreo is the best example. oreo s social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. completely product focused and yet always creative the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. the daily twist campaign to mark its one hundredth birthday saw the brand turn its oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for one hundred days including elvis presley a baseball and a rainbow flag in support of pride. visuals a picture is worth one words . this adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media. this is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. you can talk about a product all day but until you re able to put it in front of someone s eyes it s not going to have nearly the same effect. visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types comics memes infographics photos videos and visual note taking. coca cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. the two thousand twenty initiative video paved the way for multiway communication as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent. product demonstration the barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. customers often complain that till they don t touch try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. this can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium. product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of ar technology giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. gucci partnered with snapchat for the first global branded ar shoe try on the lens hugely increasing fanfare social message corporate social responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. if a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. if a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it. dove s steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing that s more than just marketing. the real beauty campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 200four. dove s latest campaign once again highlighted the core message going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. the courage is beautiful campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the two thousand twenty pandemic. the fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day to meet the ever changing needs of marketing heads. at the end of the day customer is indeed king . and companies would do well to remember it,social media staple evolving digital culture hard imagine time updates likes comments shares

58,95,petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nation s economy. the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country s per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment. most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. so with the covid nineteen wreaking havoc the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths. various states have provided relief packages and support but in a country as populous as ours it has hardly been appropriately implemented. delhi for instance recently announced a rupee five hundred million stimulus package to nearly five hundred rupees recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods. the seller s intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs ten but this is not enough. instead of loans the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income generating activities on a regular basis. sellers need income support to get back to work and if they can t they will never be able to repay the loan amount. in an ever changing crisis organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living. pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector but the most vulnerable sectors such as street vendors suffer the most. decreased income can affect most necessities such as payments to family and yourself. due to a lack of fixed salaries stalls cannot quit their jobs. if possible it might be only a few days unlike regular employees. for them the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger. unlike many of the businesses most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato. regret not going digital before says dilip das a street side food stall owner at sector v kolkata. dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies. it was a booming business till the arrival of covid. then with the lockdown arriving almost all the companies opted for work from home policies. dilip tried to start deliveries but with a lack of support and fear of infection that business ended before it even started. citing similar reasons swapan mondal who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone. and since sales were good he did not care about learning either. but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within four hours people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changes. furthermore the covid nineteen pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life. with most of the train network suspended the entire supply chain was disrupted. hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away awaiting the logistical issues to fix. many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well. to handle such issues vendors organizations may consider the following solutions promotion of livelihood for all vendors including sellers of non essential goods the impact of covidnineteen was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo. sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business. reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene india has different types of traditionally crowded markets even weekly markets fresh food cooked food and essentials and daily roadside markets. these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind and the government needs to publish guidelines for that. in the future sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation running water wash areas toilets in mind. authorities need to work with the town bending commission tvc . provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirements once the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid nineteen is somewhat manageable sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work. the government initiative is a welcome move but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough. in addition there are very few registered providers in india so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements. in delhi alone of the approximately three hundred street vendors only approximately 13ten0 have some sort of professional id. if all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state the government must also accept registration with workers organizations unions on behalf of government issued sales badges. ensuring social distancing and proper sanitation and hygiene at sites of businesses the government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water and soap sanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work. moreover the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working. taking steps to spread awareness of different government initiatives and reliefs many small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim. if they did many still have no idea about how to claim them. proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these small time food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business. when covid was an unknown word these shopkeepers and vendors brought the taste to our mouth gave us memories to live for filled our bellies and quenched our thirst when we needed them. it s time to provide them with a hand now when they need it.,entrepreneurs streetside food stalls form essential part economy plays significant role balancing development economy

59,96,the coronavirus also known as covid nineteen is not only a global public health emergency but also a source of significant regional and increasingly global economic disruption. this impacts the energy and climate world in many ways. the economic downturn puts pressure on global oil prices leading the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to consider further cuts to production. it hurts the demand for natural gas during a time of extremely low prices. it changes the economic energy and climate policymaking environment in china one of the most consequential energy consumers and sources of greenhouse gas emissions. and it has temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout the energy industry including renewable energy at a time when supply chain connections with china were being revaluated due to ongoing tariff and trade disputes. how consequential or transformative any of these changes are for the energy sector or for climate efforts will depend upon the ultimate trajectory of the virus outbreak itself sarah ladislaw senior vice president and director energy security and climate change program the energy sector has already felt the impacts of the coronavirus. the outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil resulting in plummeting oil prices and production declines. as we move forward then the energy sector expects to face two headwinds managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face and simultaneously coping with a low oil price scenario lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations. impact of covid nineteen on indian energy markets in india distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers sometimes even below the average cost of supply as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers. table one provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences. thus for several distribution companies the lower tariff paying consumers are cross subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers. the covid nineteen lockdown has led to shut down of all but essential commercial activities across the country. approximately one.three billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and in many cases only allowed to work from home. consequently the electricity demand from industrial and commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased. according to the power system operation corporation of india posoco the energy met on march one6th two thousand twenty which can be considered as a business as usual scenario was threefour9four mu as compared to threeoneonethree mu on march twothreerd two thousand twenty a day of voluntary curfew. it further reduced to a range between two thousand six hundred two thousand eight hundred mu between march two5th to march threeonest two thousand twenty. this trend is illustrated in the below figure one. thus firstly a key risk from the covid nineteen pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the cross subsidies provided to the lower tariff paying consumer. secondly the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any must buy commitments that they have with generators with long term power purchase agreements. the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained. thirdly at an operational level distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level. finally during this period critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employees. as seen in figure one the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just four.three percent of the total electricity transactions. however the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade. the indian energy exchange iex has seen a growth from two6one6 mu in fy two thousand nine to fifty two twofourone in fy two0nineteen. until now the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments one day ahead market two term ahead market three renewable energy certificates four energy saving certificates. recently the central electricity regulatory commission cerc finalized the regulations for implementing real time markets. this half hourly market will enable the intra day trade of electricity allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day. before the covid nineteen pandemic it was announced by cerc that the real time market would be operational from april onest two thousand twenty. however the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june onest two thousand twenty. according to media reports due to the covid nineteen pandemic some required trials could not be completed. this delay in the real time market implementation is likely to have a serious adverse impact on the indian power market. another impact of the covid nineteen pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic. it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the market clearing price which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid nineteen see figure two . thus the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing price. another point of reference is the price and clearing volume in two0nineteen. on march twotwond two thousand twenty the day of voluntary lockdown the clearing volume was ninety seven.five gwh and the clearing price was twonineteen5.foureight rupee mwh. in comparison on the same day in two0nineteen the clearing volume was one07.ninety eight gwh and the clearing price was twoeightone6.oneeight rupee mwh. from the start of the lockdown from march two5nd to april onest two thousand twenty the average clearing volume was one0four.two7 gwh compared to onethree0.twofour gwh in two0nineteen during the same period. similarly the average market clearing price was twoone55.9three rupee mwh in two thousand twenty as compared to threethree7one.0two5 rupee mwh in two0nineteen for the same period. views of the shareholders in india the lockdown has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services. this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand given that these segments constitute about four0 percent of the all india electricity demand a statement issued by the rating firm said. further these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments. this apart with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out it added. icra ratings group head and senior vice president corporate ratings sabyasachi majumdar said the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand with demand expected to decline by about two0 two5 percent on a year on year basis during the period of lockdown. this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments. the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs. onethree0 billion per month on an all india basis. this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms increase their subsidy requirement and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies. the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies. the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators. the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states with payment due of more than rs eighty five thousand crore as of november two0nineteen at all india level as per the data on praapti portal. with covid nineteen lockdown accentuating the delays in payments the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective. however it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a three month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term. the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial. the revenues for power generation companies having long term power purchase agreements ppas with the state distribution utilities discoms will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and must run status in case of nuclear and renewable power projects.average monthly thermal plf would further dip to fifty fifty two percent against 6three percent in the corresponding period of the previous year due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently power generation companies especially those without any long term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short term power exchange market said icra ratings sector head vice president girishkumarkadam.the under construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability following the lockdown. given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid nineteen in china. this delay in turn would increase the pre operative expenses and the overall project cost which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns. in this context the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak under the force majeure clause. given the execution headwinds amid covid nineteen affecting qone of fytwo thousand twenty twoone and assuming the normalcy thereafter the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about two5 percent thus estimated at about eight gw against earlier estimates of oneone gw in fytwo thousand twenty twoone said kadam.,coronavirus covid global public health emergency source significant regional increasingly

60,97,in december two thousand nineteen a novel coronavirus strain sars cov two emerged in the city of wuhan china. the disease called covid nineteen spread to almost every nation in the world creating widespread havoc and disruption in routine life. who recognized it as a pandemic on march ten two0two0. as of april nineteen two0two0 worldwide around two4 lakh people have been infected and more than one.six lakh people have succumbed to covid nineteen. though a vaccine hasn t been developed yet the spread of coronavirus can be stopped by washing hands frequently covering one s mouth while coughing and practicing social distancing from other people. countries across the world are using lockdowns as an effective way to stop the spread. two9 kb of rna has brought the world down to its knees. one third of the global population has been in lockdown. schools colleges businesses services that are considered non essential have been put on hold for an indefinite period. even after lifting restrictions a global recession even worse than the one in two008 is going to be expected. now arriving at the main field of discussion i.e. hospitality industry. how covid nineteen impact hospitality propulsion was building for two0two0 to be a year of focal collective action on sustainability. the covid nineteen outbreak has emphasized more than ever the importance of future proofing business for growth and resilience. the hospitality industry includes various services like lodging food and beverage events tourism transportation theme parks etc. before covid nineteen prevailed we all know that this industry was in much demand and was also one of the major sources of the rising economy. during vacation and festive periods these were always full of people worldwide. as of now due to the havoc created and ongoing lockdown they are bearing many losses and is one of the main reason for the decreasing economy. have you ever thought of hotels been converted into hospitals quarantine centers and isolation centers yes my dear people amidst this outbreak many of the hospitality industry properties be it tiny or enormous have come forward to help the nation fight this life menacing virus. taj hotel in mumbai is attentively aware of its responsibility towards the community and has opened its doors for the major frontline workers i.e. medical fraternities to stay at their place while they combat the spread of this treacherous virus. also many of the government bodies have been transformed to provide shelter to the homeless. recently in vadodara gujarat the building which was built for the employees aiming to work for the major mumbai ahmedabad bullet train project has been come forward to make it an isolation center for doctors and nurses. railways the lifeline of citizens. as railways have started their service years ago from that period they are being considered as the lifeline of citizens in many metropolitan cities. today at the time of the global pandemic railways haven t backed off from the position of the lifeline. yes my dear friends you have heard it right railway coaches in india have been turning into the hospital and isolation centers marking their presence by helping the government to increase the number of isolation beds. also many special parcel express trains are running in the entire nation to fulfill the needs of people by transporting essential commodities and goods. hospitality has been one of the most innovative industries in the crisis so far. connections have been rapidly formed to donate food and beverages to local charities from various hotels. many of the hospitality bodies are standing in solidarity with the communities affected by this threatening disease by lighting their windows in the shape of a heart seen in hotels across the world. with this outbreak there is a sharp drop in tourists worldwide as the aviation railways and public transport buses have come to a standstill due to severe government restrictions. today it is clear that hospitality industries must be prepared for various situations like a pandemic climate change etc. as of now they are facing devastating and disastrous covid nineteen impact on its various sectors. the debt being the normal capital intensive component has to be serviced by payment of interest on debt and repayment of debt. hotels being labor intensive have lots of fixed costs such as wage bills besides paying government levies minimum load charges etc. the earlier indian hospitality industry was on average witnessing six5 to seventy percent of occupancy till the end of february. the first few days of march were fine once things started accelerating the occupancy has gone down to a severe minimum. also as soon as the pandemic ends by god s grace the hospitality industry will still face some loss as the tourists will be much lesser in the beginning months. as soon as the crisis gets over the hospitality industry will have a very crucial role to play in rehabilitating lives within their local communities. millions of people will be unemployed leaving them at high risk of poverty and exploitation. as the industry starts to recover hospitality will be one of the sources to increase employment to the needy ones taking the poverty level to a minimum. within india after the crisis over people should travel to the less known and highly economically affected destinations to help the hospitality industry overcome the loss they bore due to covid nineteen. hence the hospitality industry suffered and is suffering a lot due to this pandemic and despite that it is also helping the nation to win against this dangerous disease. thus covid nineteen impact on hospitality let s be grateful to all the frontline workers saving the entire nation and also be thankful to all the various sectors of the hospitality industry who have come forward to help and serve the nation.,coronavirus sars cov emerged wuhan disease called covid

61,98,as a race we are not ready for any kind of crisis. we have fire extinguishers in buildings but barely any knowledge of how to use it. we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse that of being in unprecedented times . the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis. if we look back we can see that this crisis was not avoidable. there was a lot we could have done but because we underestimated it so much the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy. we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities. first let s look at this in a reflective mode. what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not. one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse the propagation of fake news. take india for example. clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified. we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner. the spread of accurate and timely information is a must. if we had spread awareness earlier we could have controlled the number of cases better like new zealand and ireland have done. secondly in a situation of crisis the first thing to spread is fake news. it is imperative that the government social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly. since there is no accurate and transparent information a lot of uncertainty exists in the society. this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market which in turn leads to an economic slowdown. past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information. organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees. moreover we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns. as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns curfews national emergencies and pandemics the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers. not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis. in such situations they can t even afford basic amenities. india witnessed a mass exodus recently with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot. this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease. the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice. they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home. this is something that they can still include in their relief programs. government intervention is a must right now. this can be done in two ways. first is to create more employment opportunities. governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency. health water sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies. intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs. secondly if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth. a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference. having better avenues for cash transfers easier loans and more exchange will automatically help. a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work. however industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged. for example it sector health food and agriculture etc. moreover governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand the internet even in the times of physical social distancing we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates. governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit communicate policy strategies and inform people. businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale. to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative. use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing hygiene and steps to be followed. all diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies. however with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed. our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing. countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease. maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity. while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too. we must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well being now. in the past when economies took a hit due to the two thousand eight recession or calamities the first thing to break was people s self esteem. suicide rates amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold. we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible. we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help. social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many. lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed. governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain. we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing. i don t believe that every crisis is the same. of course there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see. even though these are different times there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences. we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy our mental peace and prevent the spread of the virus. the past has a lot to offer if we ponder. we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future. our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work maintaining employee morale is important and that social. engagement is imperative. if we use these tools efficiently we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it.,kind crisis fire extinguishers buildings barely knowledge convince prepared

62,99,covid nineteen an unprecedented pandemic for us but a can be possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year two thousand twenty. the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs desa stated that the covid nineteen pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to one percent in two thousand twenty a reversal from the previous forecast of two.five percent growth. more than six.six million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf. india is facing its biggest crisis in decades with a three week lockdown initially but extending further in a nation of one.three billion people likely to result in an economic recession millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor. it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself. on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario. water is getting clearer the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers telly and social media platforms on day to day basis. but this is the storyline of the present what about the future are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again after this storm of covid nineteen it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario. the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels hostels and shopping malls. all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations. the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and in demand fields. not only this but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward. the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production delivery and surveillance inculcating many more. in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectures. even the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention. the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety agility and work to be a top priority. the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture. various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine apps. new businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices. start up culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world. the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years. since the global economy has fumbled countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase. they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes. even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries. it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next elections. unfortunately the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth. it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development. as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial markets. but there is a possibility that several start ups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin point. in the culmination we can say this pandemic is like blessing in disguise producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on micro economy. the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres. quite a while ago we all were chit chatting about the digital era how this is benefiting us covid nineteen revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future. it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaboration the businesses will soon rise again people will get back to their jobs vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature again shows it s color and we as a human abide with its outcomes learning some new lessons and keeping this cycle of fall and growth running.,covid unprecedented pandemic possibility great leaders action rising corollary pandemic prodigious analysis department

two0onethree involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly seventy countries and international organizations in asia europe and africa. curtailed connectivity after covidonenine a devastating economic collapse of potentially historic proportions after covidonenine leading to social and political turmoil in a number of countries and curtailed connectivity. interestingly the pandemic has exposed the risks and weaknesses of global interconnectedness which will affect china s bri. funding shortfall for bri so far bri has been powered primarily by china whose growth rates were decreasing even before the outbreak. exports hit with the united states and europe reeling from the pandemic chinese exports will take a big hit. china confronts major risk of debt on belt and road due to pandemic china s growth hit a near thirty year low of six.one percent roughly five million people in china lost their jobs in the first two months of two0two0. last february china s official urban unemployment jumped to an unprecedented six.two percent. unemployed number may go up to nine million by the end of two0two0. china will have to choose out of two competing priorities so not only may bri be short of cash but it will also be hard to sell at home all economies along bri routes affected pakistan host to the biggest bri megaproject in the world is poised to sustain a dollar eight.two billion loss according to adb. the respective figure for bangladesh is dollar three billion. thailand is now bracing up for a recession. africa is equally vulnerable as china is the continent s largest market. covidonenine hit chinese companies executing bri contracts can rely on support from the cdb in the form of low cost financing. yet chinese policy banks will be increasingly picky and inclined to stay away from new projects that may turn out to be loss makers. china development bank to support belt and road companies hit by coronavirus xinhua the coronavirus and xi

one0 reshape the global order under extreme circumstances beijing will not consider the bri as important. is the bri finished then short term yes bri will face trouble in particular the summer of

initiative s fuzzy content is being further enriched with the health silk road add on narrative and mask diplomacy in a major soft power push. long term a changed bri will emerge the bri is bound to change. strategies will change. it might even be defined properly seven years after this ambitious initiative was announced it remains a blurred vision in need of a comprehensive conceptual framework international standards and a coherent implementation strategy. this is one of the reasons why the bri has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries. a shift away from roads and bridges bri expenditure up to two0onenine stood at dollar fivefourfive billion. wb estimate about two thirds of spending on bri projects has gone into the energy sector and transport however developing countries in need of infrastructure will be terribly cash strapped there may be a shift away from roads bridges and coalfired power plants funded through chinese loans. new bri projects will probably be more strategically chosen. beijing has been investing in the creation of a globe spanning network of economic corridors logistics zones and financial centers with stress laid on seaports and adjacent areas. egypt s suez canal economic zone and sri lanka s colombo port city clearly show this trend. in addition projects are likely to focus on more sophisticated forms of connectivity such as fiveg networks or in the wake of the pandemic disaster management public health related high tech and even remote surgery. china will surely use the bri for the projection of its soft power an increasingly important battlefield in international relations. the world has become aware of the risks of overwhelming reliance on china. amid of coronavirus outbreak we can see the

65,102,perhaps the virtual illusion has become today s new reality . inquisitive about the conclusion let s attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself. ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the onenine70s a new dimension was put before human beings intangible in nature and paradoxically engulfed us since then. it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways. the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences. with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale. as we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature. concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as well. sam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time. as our academics advanced the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time. we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical. he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers. the situation turned grim when he wasn t able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting. he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never ending backlog of games. as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse. he was struggling. it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage. as sophomores we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good. a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain. he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep ran into financial losses aggression draped him his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine and signs of depression were visible on the upfront. poker was the tartar that he had caught. the game of cards as most of us would perceive it rather proved to be the fulcrum of sam s near future. in the quest of pleasure through online games he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals. he was suffering from internet gaming disorder igd his condition deteriorated as days passed by. apparently from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one it took a toll on his physical health. mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics. the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms. during that phase the peer group gaming group gained more influence than parental control. days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds. since a large amount of money is involved in gambling a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling. the practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year. sam was by no means in anyone s good books. no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen. he was abandoned. we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth. with mutual consensus we decided to go ahead with sam. initially we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect. unfortunately he wasn t able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out. at present he plays poker on a professional level keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of. earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in depth to date. can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison sir newton sir tesla sir einstein and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist hadn t he chose that path. not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree. our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games feels so numb. millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year. presently the prevalence of igd among the adolescent group was between one.three percent to onenine.nine percent and males reported more prevalence than females. in the fiscal year 20onenine there were three00 million online gamers in india. this number was estimated to go up to four hundred forty million gamers by the fiscal year two thousand twenty two. overall india ranked the highest in terms of the growth in online game downloads on app stores with a growth rate of one65 percent between 20one6 to 20one8. seventy five percent of young people use a mobile phone to play different games 2one percent use pc laptop. games like pubg that promote virtual violence calls for the stern attention of the responsible demographics. as per a study online games are directly affecting the neurons leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks. as per the world health organization depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word depression that didn t exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected person s life situation. anything in excess is poison. so are games. in deed the virtual illusion has become today s new reality .,virtual illusion today

declared covid nineteen as a pandemic and issued guidelines like sanitizing hands regularly wearing masks and social distancing as viable methods for prevention against this virus. what is social distancing and how is it helpful social distancing means staying away from other people. so to limit human interaction various governments all over the world chose life before the economy and ordered complete lockdown in their countries. all schools colleges offices factories public places etc. were shutdown from immediate effect. as of 7th june two thousand twenty covid nineteen confirmed cases worldwide are sixty nine ninety four six hundred five with four two fourfive3 deaths and 3four twenty 0foureight recovered. the usa didn t impose lockdown in the early stages due to which it has nearly nineteen eighty eight fivefourfive confirmed cases with a death rate of five.six percent as of 7th june two thousand twenty whereas in india lockdown was imposed at the first stage and so we have two four7 confirmed cases with a death rate of two.eight percent . impact on environment rights reserved to statista as we know it is us humans who keep exploiting nature which has nurtured us and turn a blind eye to the havoc of our misdeeds. current environmental concerns like depletion of the ozone layer climate change soil erosion air pollution water pollution soil pollution acid rain noise pollution loss of biodiversity and many more are a result of our selfish and never ending desires for development at the cost of the environment. but when the lockdown was imposed worldwide our lives just stopped. air traffic due to flights dropped by 9five percent cntraveller . since no one was allowed to leave homes carbon footprint per person dropped significantly. the hindu newspaper reported a seventeen percent decline in carbon pollution during the pandemic peak. according to an article in economic times onmay 1fourth two thousand twenty global air quality has improved this year

sounds like lock down is good for environment . right humans are getting what they deserved animals are safe and the environment is healing due to a reduction in pollution levels. but no. all this is just the tip of the iceberg . the reality is that humans despite being under threat due to covid nineteen cyclones earthquakes and locusts attacks are still damaging the environment. according to voicesofyouth.org there has also been an increase in medical waste much of the personal protective equipment that healthcare professionals are using can only be worn once before being disposed of. hospitals in wuhan for example produced over twenty0 tons of waste per day during the peak of their outbreak compared to an average of fewer than five0 tons prior. according to mongabay news despite covid amazon deforestation is racing higher. the new figures come amid rising fears that illegal loggers and speculators are using the covid nineteen crisis as an opportunity to invade indigenous lands and protected areas in brazil . according to an article in conservation international an expert said in africa there has been an alarming increase in bush meat harvest and wildlife trafficking that is directly linked to covid nineteen related lockdowns decreased food availability and damaged economies as a result of tourism collapses apart from the above mentioned media channels various

67,104,epidemics in general have both direct and indirect costs associated with direct and indirect measures adopted to counter control the epidemic which generally have both short run and long run economic and social consequences. the two thousand nineteen coronavirus covid nineteen outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe. the first case was detected on 26th december two thousand nineteen in china. the world health organization who prepared the first diagnostic kit on one4th january two thousand twenty. as the global coronavirus or covid nineteen pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling it s effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors. supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms. according to the data produced by supply management s report on business show that pmi purchasing manager s index has declined one percent in the month of february. mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum transportation and textile industries. although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules. a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily seventy five percent of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than eighty percent believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid nineteen disruptions. the effective shutdown of industrial activity i.e. china ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide. imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback. several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic. boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid nineteen virus. the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model i.e. the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by twenty five thirty percent . the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus. however the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress. this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model. the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports. this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output. the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand. clearly the contraction of the aggregate demand side generates an economic slowdown. on the other hand restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers. note that software or financial service producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short run to medium run since those works could be easily carried out based on work from home anthem. however reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities. this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation. in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india rbi to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock since the escalation of demand specifically for non traded products without an adequate increase in production supply would only result in inflation. in other words supply side management must go hand in hand with demand side policies. even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government however conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities. most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense. at the same time exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies. this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future. corona virus has mainly affected raw material export driven countries. with the covid nineteen virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders production and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories. there has been a huge revenue impact. long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid nineteen pandemic. the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes. as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging. at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices. risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future. there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile. the crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of two thousand eight. this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter sectoral backward and forward linkage effect however the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector. in the present situation the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non regulatory authority and out of direct government control. moreover lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker. the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long lasting. the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies,epidemics general direct indirect costs direct indirect measures adopted counter control epidemic generally run run economic social

68,105,covid nineteen has bought the world to its knees. with businesses being shut travel being banned schools and colleges being closed we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally. we ve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid nineteen on the economy education mental health and every other possible aspect. but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid nineteen on office space and co working industries. well it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now but the covid period hasn t ended. this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. the same will be the condition in co working industries wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof. however these problems are quite obvious though people haven t thought about them much but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions. coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country just the way a car needs repair after an accident our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. but unlike a car our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support. needless to say the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary. people tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. the problem doesn t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. and in today s world where people keep money at the top of their priority list comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company. since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better but however will bring huge losses in the long run. the fact is employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss s eyes. moreover since there will be comparisons among the employees it might happen that the employee of the month ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don t. this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. in fact employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best. such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices wherein employees will compete for attention and resources which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. and all this will happen because of only one thing lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time. another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long lasting impact of covid nineteen is the co working industry and offices. this is because there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure as well the rent will remain the same. because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. however the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same. if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time which they most likely will we will observe a scene of intra company as well as inter company competition. also our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition which itself will be a result of limited mental space. covid nineteen will have severe impacts on the office mental space of companies and people. people s thoughts how they treat others along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone s lives. moreover we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. however we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.,covid bought world knees businesses shut travel banned schools colleges closed observed impeccable amount sorrow despise great amount mental torture

71,108,as business close to help prevent transmission of covid nineteen financial concerns and job losses are one of the first human impacts of the virus covid nineteen is in decline in china. there are now more new cases every day in europe than there were in china at the epidemic s peak and italy has surpassed it as the country with the most deaths from the virus it took sixty seven days to reach the first one hundred confirmed cases worldwide eleven days for this to increase to two hundred and just four to reach three hundred confirmed cases a figure now exceeded. in recent weeks we have seen the significant economic impact of the coronavirus on financial markets and vulnerable industries such as manufacturing tourism hospitality and travel. travel and tourism account for ten percent of the global gdp and fifty million jobs are at risk worldwide. global tourism travel and hospitality companies closing down affects smes globally. this in turn affects many people typically the least well paid and those self employed or working in informal environments in the gig economy or in part time work with zero hours contracts. some governments have announced economic measures to safeguard jobs guarantee wages and support the self employed but there is a lack of clarity in many countries about how these measures will be implemented and how people will manage a loss of income in the short term. behind these statistics lie the human costs of the pandemic from the deaths of friends and family to the physical effects of infection and the mental trauma and fear faced by almost everyone. not knowing how this pandemic will play out affects our economic physical and mental well being against a backdrop of a world that for many is increasingly anxious unhappy and lonely. fear of the unknown can often lead to feelings of panic for example when people feel they are being denied life saving protection or treatment or that they may run out of necessities which can lead to panic buying.psychological stress is often related to a sense of a lack of control in the face of uncertainty. in all cases lack of information or the wrong information either provided inadvertently or maliciously can amplify the effects. there is a huge amount of misleading information circulating online about covid nineteen from fake medical information to speculation about government responses. people are susceptible to social media posts from an apparently trustworthy source often referred to as an uncle with a masters post possibly amplified and spread by copypasta posts which share information by copying and pasting and make each new post look like an original source as opposed to posts that are liked or shared or retweeted . sadly criminals and hackers are also exploiting this situation and there has been a significant rise in coronavirus themed malicious websites with more than sixteen new coronavirus related domains registered since january two thousand twenty. hackers are selling malware and hacking tools through covid nineteen discount codes on the darknet many of which are aimed at accessing corporate data from home workers laptops which may not be as secure as outside an office environment. social distancing and lockdowns have also prompted altruistic behaviors in part because of the sense that we re all in this together . many people report being bored or concerned about putting on weight others have discovered a slower pace of life and by not going out and socializing have found more time for family others and even their pets. the downside of self isolation or social lockdown are symptoms of traumatic stress confusion and anger all of which are exacerbated by fear of infection having limited access to supplies of necessities inadequate information or the experience of economic loss or stigma. this stress and anxiety can lead to increased alcohol consumption as well as an increase in domestic and family violence.in jingzhou a town near wuhan in hubei province reports of domestic violence during the lockdown in february two thousand twenty were more than triple the number reported in february twentynineteen. health measures must be the first priority for governments business and society. it is important for businesses to show solidarity and work together to protect staff local communities and customers as well as keeping supply chains manufacturing and logistics working.according to research my employer is more trusted than the government or media. daily updates on a company website with input from scientists and experts are recommended to counter politicized messages in the media and from governments. this is particularly true for large companies that have the capacity to do this. messages about what businesses are doing for their employees and in their communities is also important. some companies are helping schoolchildren from vulnerable families who can no longer get a school meal others are providing public health messages about effective handwashing. even ceos can show they are working from home and self isolating while still being effective in their leadership. following who advice there is a need for the business community to move from general support to specific actions and focus on countries access to critical supplies including a community package of critical items a list of forty six items that all countries need . of these items twenty are either not available locally or available stocks are too limited. these missing items fall into four categories the call for action is for more money to work with manufacturers to create capacity and to organize purchasing so there is guaranteed access especially for poorer countries with less resilient public health systems. the concept is to create a global security stockpile of supplies and equipment an effort that needs,business prevent transmission covid financial concerns job losses human impacts virus covid decline

72,109,so not beginning with once upon a time because it is not a fairytale. before the advent of this deadly virus called coronavirus or with all love that we might want to call it covid nineteen the life wasn t smooth as people are cribbing about. it is written by adam smith that human wants are endless and thus we know humans can never be satisfied. when we were busy and all the work and stressful lives we all wanted breaks we used t crib and cry about not getting time for family and friends. not having time for self this coronavirus outbreak had taught each one of us that how important it is to be thankful for everything we have in our lives while sitting i just realize that how lucky we are that we do not have to go out amidst this crisis to work and earn bread. how sorry i m for each the daily wage workers who have no other way but to go out the second lesson is that we all can survive without fast food we all are chefs and have made a lot of appealing and tasty dishes without spending a huge and bogus amount. the third lesson is family is everything during this quarantine i realized that spending time with my family is so stress busting and helps me be creative. we need to have other hobbies than going out and chilling. we need to look at the weather it s april and it is not that scorching heat we used to face it s lovely nature is recovering. whenever i wake up in the morning i go to my terrace for yoga and find many families there walking gossiping it has brought everyone close. mended relation. all the instagram stories make me realize that we all have talent just we don t have time to self introspect we all are running in a race to be the best. from an economic point of view though savings are leakage in the money flow but still savings are important for unforeseen circumstances. this lockdown has given us all time to reconnect and get together with all our loved ones to do what we want. the main lesson is that we should enjoy life and every moment as it is. we never know what might happen to anyone. we never know who could be the last person we are talking to last person we text let us all be nice to each other there are many lessons that we have learned. one of them is the awareness about the cleanliness. the term cleanliness that took modi ji about five years to teach people about swachh bharat abhiyan a single case of the virus has taught everyone the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. corona virus crisis has taught how the humans at halt can lead the nature to work at itself. nature has its own mysteries and how what the humans have done to its beings is done to them they are too imprisoned like the animals they have had imprisoned for years away from their homelands. this crisis has gaped the differences between the communities and brought the humans together. we can see a wave of excitement in everyone when modi ji gives his tasks. still remember how my colony just rang up with the sound of bells and plates and claps. and how beautiful it looked with the balconies lit up with diyas and candles. it looked like diwali in the month of april but diwali with no pollution and noise. this crisis has made everyone of us thankful to the medical and nursing staff who had been working twenty four seven hours away from their families so that we can stay safe with our families . it has just made me realize that we never know if we ll see the sun tomorrow if we ll see the people we love if we can talk to them again so let s not hold grudges and let the go and flow . corona virus has united all the humanity against a cause to defeat a virus this virus has made the world a better place there are no terror attacks there are no rape cases there are no murders no loots. the earth is all healing.,beginning time fairytale advent deadly virus called coronavirus covid life wasn smooth people cribbing written human endless humans satisfied busy work stressful lives wanted breaks crib cry time family friends time coronavirus outbreak taught important thankful lives sitting realize amidst crisis work earn bread wage workers lesson survive food chefs made lot appealing tasty dishes spending huge bogus amount lesson family quarantine realized spending time family stress busting helps creative hobbies chilling weather scorching heat face nature recovering wake morning terrace yoga find families walking gossiping brought mended relation instagram stories make realize talent time introspect running economic point view savings leakage flow savings important unforeseen

74,111,while coronavirus has affected the life of every individual it has also affected various industries for better or for worse. while certain industries like pharma mobile and web streaming industries fitness and teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic industries like tourism fast food industry retail and leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to coronavirus impact during this lockdown to prevent the spreading of coronavirus impact almost all of the companies have adopted a work from home culture and have used various teleconference apps to hold meetings. teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies don t get disrupted. also confined to their homes people have started engaging more in fitness apps and web streaming services like netflix youtube and amazon prime are at their zenith. while these industries are thriving in this pandemic the most affected industry during this time is the hospitality industry. hospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation traveling airlines hotels and lodges etc. hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry. the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar but they have their subtle distinctions. tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home. the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction. their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists. the hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations travelling and food and drinks. accommodations include hotels resorts hostels motels etc. the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks now have no option but to lay off their employees. many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments. the same is the case for resorts hostels motels etc. that provide accommodations. since there are no occupants there is no money inflow which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore. businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation. various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation. the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business. traveling restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of coronavirus. travel agencies car rentals tour operators flights and airlines have been hit quite severely by covid nineteen. due to the fear of spreading coronavirus people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials. coronavirus impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where. many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the coronavirus crisis. havoc is created across the aviation industry. the months from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry. but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad. airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis. to cope up with this situation airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo while various airlines have laid off. commercial travel has dropped tremendously. also there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices. it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists. apart from airlines the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year. they are facing cancellations of bookings and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis. it is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control the travel and tour industry can take about ten months to return to normalcy. however this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industry s future. many foods and drinks services fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people services that provide them leisure time. their customers not only include tourists but locals passerby s etc. these mainly include restaurants tea and coffee shops bars and pubs catering etc. catering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizer s preference. due to this pandemic many countries are in lockdown and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution. due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing catering services are halted for now. restaurants tea and coffee shops pubs and bars have all closed down not only for the safety of their customers but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers. however a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of coronavirus. the number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of covid nineteen as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation. though quick service food deliveries can cope better than the full service restaurants during this crisis. because of this unprecedented crisis all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times. without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions it will be difficult for various establishments to survive through this crisis. it is being indicated that the world will face the worst recession since the great depression during this pandemic with so many people losing their jobs especially those working in the hospitality industry. thus coronavirus impact on different industries,coronavirus affected life individual

hundred coronavirus better known as covid nineteen is a challenge unfathomed. history is earmarked with infections and diseases that ravaged continents time and again black death decimated europe by claiming two00 million lives between one thousand three hundred forty seven and 135two smallpox killed five hundred million over decades bouts of cholera outbreaks the emergence of hiv aids and what not the list is huge and intimidating. but covid nineteen is cut from a different cloth exposing various loopholes and the modern world s inability to fend off pandemics and epidemics despite advancements in science healthcare and technology. the covid nineteen pandemic has invoked an unprecedented seismic shift across segments the world economy is declining third world countries with underdeveloped healthcare industry are spiraling into poverty and darkness read about ecuador being trapped between death and debt the imf declaring a global recession it s a concoction of tragedy turmoil and tribulations. one particularly interesting domain to mull over is the world of work an umbrella term that encompasses industries businesses organizations and all that jazz. hundreds of thousands of layoffs are happening in sectors like travel and tourism hospitality manufacturing and basically every other customer facing domain not to mention those which rely solely or heavily on physical labor. quarantine a measure proposed and already implemented by hundreds of nations to limit the spread of coronavirus has stopped people from going to their workplace. offices are empty factories are silent with machines gathering dust hotels and restaurants are deserted etc. the outcome has compelled organizations to remain strong in the face of this adversity and circumvent the problem of employees not being able to step out of their homes. the concept of work from home or wfh is now mainstream and the irrational ideology of decline in productivity and revenue upon implementing wfh has gone for a toss. the surge in the use of video conferencing apps attests to this. zoom a popular video call software has witnessed more than double the number of users in march. organizations are now cognizant of wfh and its benefits. the onslaught of normal working conditions by covid nineteen has made companies revisit the concept of redundancy. it is time to re evaluate one s workforce and underline core jobs essential to keeping the company running while highlighting the not so important ones. of course to render employees jobless and terminate them at this point casts a negative light on the organization s reputation. so companies are smart enough to ward such drastic cost cutting measures at the moment a few that did so are under the radar of their respective governments for the wrong reasons. it s not unreasonable to expect corporations to impose significant changes in workforce strength and hierarchy once economic rectitude kicks in. with passing time more and more countries now have lockdown measures in place. confined within homes those with jobs now see the term work life balance unravel. the vicious cycle of work wake up go to the office back at home have food sleep and repeat the same all over again is a hot button topic today. the disastrous consequences of burnout at work job related stress and the consistent pressure to perform are at the receiving end of much needed attention like never. often neglected aspects of life like health family contentment and well being are not taken for granted anymore. the canard that coronavirus and its virulence is restricted only to the aged has been put to rest. with fatalities in every age group workers now grasp the importance of neglecting health for office. once life s back on track a reduction in work related burnouts and health issues is imminent. boredom and restlessness brought about by lockdown have compelled people to upskill themselves the presence of mooc and online courses has buttressed e learning online education. linkedin is now riddled with professionals flaunting the latest certification from udemy and coursera. it took a pandemic for many employees to correlate continuous learning with success and recognition at the workplace. after a couple of months you ll find yourself surrounded by smart peers whom you didn t heed to earlier. under the pretext of pursuing long left hobbies and passions the number of active freelancers has increased. individuals pressed by office workers are using the extra time at hand to take up freelancing and augment their primary source of income. content writers copywriters graphic designers tutors are now dime a dozen. will freelancers sustain this flow once the health scare settles we don t know. but covid nineteen without any second thoughts has given a leg up to the freelancer culture. working across time zones has always been a bummer. converting indian standard time to eastern time zone central time to some other time zone etc. for meetings meant ensuing headaches. to ensure the business continues employees divided by geographies are now more accommodating to get cross functional tasks done. organizations are witnessing better coordination and collaboration across teams sitting in different parts of the world. car manufacturers are developing ventilators hundreds of tech ventures are building covid trackers predictors assistant chatbots and awe inspiring apps logistics are bending accepted ways to deal with transportation an influx of change for good lies in front of us. unimaginable innovation and creativity have risen from the depths of oblivion the dark side of social media i.e. the use of such platforms to spread rumors and false news is has become more evident than ever. an indian it giant expelled one of its employees in lieu of his abominable facebook post to spread coronavirus. organizations will heighten vigilance of what their staff post publish or advocate on digital platforms. condemnable information would bring in dire consequences that extend beyond simple termination. it seems social media has taken a hit for good. all in all the global outbreak of covid nineteen has ushered in a slew of radical changes to how work is perceived in the grand scheme of things. two0two0 will go down in history books as the year that shook the very fundamentals of the world of work,respiratory illness started patient wuhan engulfed entire globe clutches confirmed cases deaths coronavirus covid challenge unfathomed history earmarked

76,113,the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid nineteen pandemic. the indian hotel sector has been hit hard tussling with significantly low demand with very few future bookings. since the outbreak of covid nineteen companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india. the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with sixty sixty five percent of interviews getting postponed especially in the hospitality services sector following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing. currently with the imposition of section one hundred forty four there are barely any bookings being made for the future and the current ones all stand canceled. in this scenario there is limited scope for quick revival. it s proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level in working together showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees. the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities in defining for instance new delivery concepts human capital sharing platforms initiatives in promoting the staycation or holiday concept and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts security plans defining standard operating procedures social media plans etc. this may seem obvious but it s worth looking at this a bit closer. the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants bars and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams they d just denied. many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed. this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff. the impact of the novel coronavirus on india s hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe. while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year uncertainty still lurks. a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future. this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk. furthermore the entry level has postponed the hiring for the near future. let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors. the hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and up gradation. this stop gap plan is about maintaining a thread of communication using social media and advertisements with the consumers. it s also about strengthening the communication within the company making a budget and plan for re opening and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible. another step is where all the action is required by the sector. once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again it is suggested that any plan of re opening must be done keeping long term benefits and safety compliances in mind. it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers. the hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spending.this way coronavirus effect on the hospitality the government is already taking measures to combat the effects of the pandemic on the country. here are the multiple measures if taken by the government of india can help the indian hotel industry weather the current storm. really this is anyone s guess. we don t yet know how long it will take for the epidemic to peak and for us to be allowed out again but one thing i am sure of is that we ll all be desperate to meet up with friends over dinner or have a pint in the pub with proper support from the government i think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly but perhaps not in its former form. it is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants leaving space for innovative new entrants. the crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps if regulation allows these will stick becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams. thus coronavirus effect on the hospitality and other sectors.,hospitality sector witnessed unprecedented deceleration wake covid

77,114,stay at home crisis pandemic covid nineteen these are just a few terms that come to mind when you wake up every morning and listen to the world mourning. with the coronavirus pandemic hitting almost two hundred ten countries throughout the globe and having no possible cure for the foreseeable future the state of the world is as dismal as it can ever get. the great lockdown as it is being called is having adverse effects on almost everything a common man does but more importantly having a grave impact on the world of work. in this article let s look at what is the current status of the working population throughout the world and what lies ahead in the future. two thousand twenty marked the beginning of a new decade and a seemingly difficult one for various organizations across the world. the first quarter of two thousand twenty brought with it major issues for the workforce. the implementation of lockdowns in various countries such as india germany italy china the uk etc. has made work from home a compulsion for everyone except those working for essential goods and services companies. the crisis has already led to a worldwide economic slowdown and a period of recession is looming on our heads. the international monetary fund imf has predicted a shrink of three percent in the global gdp indicating the extent of the crisis. the severity of the issue is being felt by various big companies in india and other major powers of the world. in an interview anand mahindra ceo of m m group said that the manufacturing and production sector has been hit the hardest with the lack of labor force. he mentioned the lack of wage workers who help in loading and unloading of material is making transport a major issue for his company also hinting at the importance of these small workers on the macro level. ceos and managers of various organizations are having a hard time dealing with this crisis. with almost all mncs such as pwc bcg deloitte ibm infosys etc. making work from home compulsory till around mid may twenty the importance of technology is at its peak now. whether it s conducting meetings over zoom or conference calls over duo staying at home and working is becoming normal as we move forward. service based companies are finding it easier to complete their tasks as compared to product based companies. according to the imf the world is going to lose usd nine trillion in output in two thousand twenty which is more than the combined output of both germany and japan. the manufacturing sector is one of the worst hit by the pandemic. china the world s largest exporter of goods and the epicenter of the covid nineteen pandemic has seen a significant fall in output in the first two months of two thousand twenty. chinese industrial production has fallen by 1three.five percent and major manufacturers in china are facing problems relating to the shutdown and lack of workforce. restrictions have affected the supply of chinese companies like jcb saic nissan to name a few. organizations such as samsung kia hyundai and all other non essential goods companies have been forced to shut down factories to comply with lockdown norms and for the safety of their employees. indian manufacturing giants such as bajaj and tata have taken the toll due to the lockdown measures in india. bajaj has been forced to cut employee salaries by three0 percent and worker salaries by ten percent due to a lack of revenue. us based smartphone and tech giant apple inc. has shut all its stores worldwide with its factories in china and the usa unable to produce new products for the time being. these are just a few examples and production has been hit globally in all countries and there is a lack of demand to compliment this further enhancing the problem faced by producers. the world of work also includes those who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job i.e. the unemployed. the unemployment rate is at a staggering high across all nations affected by the pandemic. according to the us bureau of labor statistics the number of people filing for unemployment hit a record high close to seven million people. china reported an unemployment rate of six.two percent in jan twenty and figures are expected to get worse in many other countries. according to the international labor organization more than twofive million workers may go jobless soon due to this crisis and lead to a significant decline in income. the financial crisis of twenty0eight caused a twotwo million spike in unemployment worldwide and the nature of the current situation makes it more dangerous. the fall in revenues and effects on both supply as well as demand mean that companies are having a hard time maintaining their balance sheet and taking care of their liabilities. lack of job opportunities from the next quarter and salary cuts for existing employees might be the way forward in the corporate world. amongst all the negative impacts of covid nineteen on organizations across the globe there are a few opportunities that are ready to be explored after this crisis. technology and artificial intelligence are key aspects that have been mentioned in the past to be the ones contributing to the growth and a rise in revenues for various businesses. in times of social distancing and a shutdown of physical services the digital markets may prove to be game changers in the near future. offering products online and promoting through digital marketing will be at the forefront. the quarantine time must be utilized in order to improve existing products and increase the customer base of companies. byju s india s famous online learning platform is leading by example in this front by offering its application essentials and courses for free. this will help them expand their brand in the coming years and create a customer base. cult fit a bangalore based fitness startup has used technology to create an application helping fitness freaks to workout from home. oneplus the chinese smartphone brand launched its new flagship the oneplus eight in an online event and created a filter to let smartphone lovers do a virtual unboxing of the device as getting the device physically is not possible at the moment due to restrictions. decathlon america s leading sports and fitness equipment brand started an online campaign we re in this together and the hashtag playitsafe to appeal to their customers and increase sales of their home workout equipment. these examples show how brands and organizations have realized the importance of this lockdown to expand their base and consolidate their position in the market as they battle out the crisis. the covid nineteen pandemic has led to chaos and panic throughout the working world. but there are huge opportunities for companies to expand and improve in the future. all organizations need to have a designed plan in place to ensure smooth functioning once the lockdown is lifted. social distancing and hygiene will become key for manufacturing industries. the travel industry which is currently in its worst state will need to recover fast in order to ensure the safe movement of passengers once borders are reopened across the world. the service sector will need to move to digital platforms and hype digital marketing. artificial intelligence will play a key role with a reduction in workforce eminent due to lack of demand. handling tasks with the help of ai and reducing the need for an employee will improve cost effectiveness until revenues rise back to normal. e learning has evolved over the past few years and its importance has been realized over this quarantine period. all major colleges and schools have transformed into an online program in order to educate students. this change is likely to be carried forward with more and more educational institutes switching platforms. e commerce has also been an integral part of the world and will become even more important in the coming days. as malls and markets are shut and are expected to remain shut e commerce websites will benefit from the same. it is also an opportunity for retailers and vendors to create their base online or sell through e retailers in order to generate revenue. small vendors and retailers will continue to be an important part of the supply of the essential good to households and improving sanitation in these places will be key. mncs that have switched to the atmosphere of work from home will find it easier to connect large groups of people together at all times and ensure all employees contribute to the smooth functioning of the companies in the crucial days up ahead. entrepreneurial minds will also be encouraged to put forth their idea and create a startup of their own to make the corporate world an improved space in the future. the world is in a state of panic and it is important for all of us to be united in this fight against covid nineteen. as employees continue to work from home and make study rooms their cabins organizations need to adapt to this new style of working and realize its importance for the coming months until a solution is found for this problem. internet and online services will play an important role in the future. this transition will lead to a better digital world and improve accessibility throughout the globe. stay safe stay

78,115,if anything kills over ten million people over the next few decades it s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war bill gates bill gates in his tedx address in two thousand fifteen pointed out to the predicament of world leaders who failed to invest sufficiently into health infrastructure and he further elaborated on the inability of the prevailing health facilities to accommodate the next pandemic the world would face. the whole world is grappling with covid nineteen the virus that took birth in the city of wuhan and spread across the globe claiming more than half a hundred thousand lives and affecting more than two million people. with the fear of the virus spreading the whole world entered into a complete and stringent lockdown mandated by the national governments. this caused economic activities worldwide to come to a standstill except for sectors that provisioned essential goods and services. the international agency imf has projected that the global output will contract by three percent in two thousand twenty which is even worse than the two thousand eight nine financial crises. moody downgraded the global growth forecast to two.five percent in two thousand twenty from an earlier estimate of five.three percent . the us economy is expected to contract by two percent euro era by two.two percent and china is expected to grow at three.three percent rather than an earlier estimate of six percent in twotwoone the national governments have been presented with inevitable challenges of ensuring sustenance and livelihood to masses improving investor confidence and preventing the economies from falling into a recession in the absence of consumerism amidst the uncertainty about the longevity and future intensity of the pandemic. the goi took the decision to enter into lockdown in the preliminary phase of the spread of the virus. the indian economy in the fiscal year twonineteen was already hit by severe npa crises. it witnessed a downward spiral and grew at a mere rate of five percent as against six.eight percent in twooneeight as per the statistics released by the nso national statistical organization. the manufacturing and construction sectors were negative outliers. the government in order to recuperate announced a plethora of decisions. the government cut the corporate tax from three percent to twotwo percent and for manufacturing enterprises from twofive percent to onefive percent . in order to strengthen the position of public sector banks the government announced the merger of ten public sector banks into four the government also announced a fiscal stimulus of one.seven lakh crores inr stepping over its fiscal deficit target in order to drive the economy out of the downward spiral and get it on the path of growth giving lubricant to an economy facing liquidity crunch with heightening npa. but the coronavirus outbreak halted the economic activity and posed government the issue of fulfilling the basic survival needs of workers in the informal sector in the wake of massive urbanization. the daily wage earners tried to walk down to their native places in huge numbers posing immense difficulty for the government. apart from that the domestic equity market indices the bse sensex and nse nifty crashed which reflected the erosion of investor confidence and reflected stealth of bearish sentiment around the world. all this amalgamated together posed a serious question on the survival of a huge chunk of the indian population and invited a lot of criticism for the government. this is when the central nda government announced a fiscal relief package the central government announced a fiscal stimulus of additional inr one.seven lakh crores that constitutes approximately .eight percent of india s gdp under pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan yojna. this fiscal stimulus is used to target the underprivileged section of the society instead of conventional indirectly lubricating the economy through deficit financing. the government under the nfsa national food security act has decided to provide an additional five kg of indian staple wheat and rice and one kg of pulses every month to people with ration cards. the government is expanding and accelerating the dissemination of unilateral transfers under various government schemes. under pm kisan scheme an indian farmer receives payment of inr six in three installments every year. out of six the goi had disbursed inr two immediately. the government has made a provision of providing two installments inr ten for the next three months those already availing old ages women or disability pension. the women who are jan dhan account holders are to receive inr five for the next three months. the government assured the availability of cooking gas by providing one lpg cylinder for the next three months to eight.three crores people covered under ujjwal yojna. the government in order to prevent the deterioration of and encourage entrepreneurial spirit in already discriminated rural women the government made a provision for women shg s where they can receive collateral free loans up to inr two lakhs under nrlm national rural livelihood mission . the government also enhanced payment under mgnrega from inr oneeight day to inr twotwo day. the government has also taken upon itself to provide for the epf contributions of onetwo percent each of the basic salaries of both employees and employers for the next three months. in order to ensure household liquidity the employees can withdraw from their epf accounts balance up to sevenfive percent . the goi is also providing insurance coverage if inr five lakh for a tenure of three months for about twotwo lakh health workers in government hospitals inclusive of asha workers medical sanitary workers and paramedics. the finance minister nirmala sitaraman also pointed out that increased money supply combined with the dollar swap with the usa will help curb the inflammatory effect also. shaktikanta das the rbi chief announced a monetary relief package for the economy that seemed to regain investor confidence as the national stock indices rallied. the following are the elements of the package despite tourism hospitality domestic trade airline industry taking a hit india was presented with quite a few opportunities as well. india came as a messiah to export hydroxychloroquine to the usa followed by indian pharmacy companies lupin dr. reddy s laboratories strides pharma s plants in india and biocon s plant in malaysia being given clearance by us fda us food and drug administration. this gives massive export opportunities to these entities improving their growth prospectus. the crash of crude oil prices caused by falling out of negotiations between opec and russia creating supply pressure along with lowered demand enabled india to lower its import bill. according to a report by icra every dollar ten decline in crude oil price saved india dollar onefive billion. not only india but countries like the usa japan uk and germany have announced massive fiscal stimulus packages to equip their economies to come out of this phase of decelerating economic activity. us announced a fiscal package of dollar two trillion with is approximately nine.three percent of its gdp. this relief package is the largest relative to the gdp is the largest of the kind in the modern american history. it is way larger than dollar eight billion assistance provided in two thousand eight. germany introduced largest fiscal stimulus in relation to gdp. the following graph indicates the fiscal stimulus as a proportion of gdp of respective countries workers in the us whose annual incomes are up to dollar sevenfive will receive dollar onetwo in direct payments as well as dollar five for every offspring. america being america came to the rescue of businesses by allocating dollar five billion to businesses and local government bodies. it announced various sectorial packages dollar five billion for passenger airlines dollar eight billion for cargo carriers dollar oneseven billion for businesses involved in maintaining national security. taking care of the small industry sector the us government committed itself to devote dollar threefive billion to the working capital requirements of these entities. the government further allocated dollar onefive billion for the health care sector dollar fourfive billion for the disaster relief fund dollar threeone billion for the education sector dollar twoseven billion for research and development and dollar onefive.five billion towards the food stamp program. . republican president donald trump has been under a lot of criticism lately. the tackling of the covid nineteen crises by america could either relinquish trump administration or them another tenure. but so far the situation seems critical with the usa registered with the maximum number of cases china the epicenter of the pandemic has been facing a lot of backlash from world powers like the usa uk france and germany each country asking for monetary compensation. the us even alleged that china has conducted low frequency nuclear tests while the whole world is anguished. china has also been frowned upon for acquiring a stake in various companies like the pboc enhancing its claim in hdfc to one percent and many other entities amidst panic selling. china also capitalized on low crude oil prices by creating massive buffers. it further exported ppe to various countries capitalizing on the minutest of opportunities available. this is the time to be prudent and try to remain optimistic as is illuminated by charlie munger i would when the worst typhoon that s ever happened comes. we just want to get through typhoon and we d rather come out it with a whole lot of liquidity.,kills people decades highly infectious virus war tedx address pointed predicament

80,117,the more you know about the past the better prepared you are for the future. as we speak the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times. the global covid nineteen pandemic has caused never seen before disruption in both public and economic life. not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded but festivals suspended families separated across countries and public healthcare systems put under tremendous stress. such a scenario is a first time for many but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before and after the due struggle emerged victoriously. as the more experienced amongst us would remember the sars and mers outbreaks in the early two000s presented a similar scenario although at a much lower rate of infection yet with higher rates of morbidity. going back further in time the nineteenone8 spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war to a standstill. considered to be the worst amongst modern era pandemics the influenza pandemic affected one third of the world s population and fifty million lives. yet preventive measures such as social distancing quarantine mass vaccinations public support and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world. we face a similar situation today an extremely infectious virus which has already spread globally confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended affecting both the government and the industries alike. can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times can our governments take note of how public policy measures adopted during the spanish flu sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemics what can the government learn the panic due to the outbreak of covid nineteen and more importantly the lockdown measures to deal with it are quite similar to those during the nineteenone8 influenza pandemic or as it is more commonly referred to as the spanish flu. large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedridden. the immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks rampant unemployment supply shortages and heavy reliance on social security systems causing a sudden strain on national economic resources. impact learnings effective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control. iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a media blackout. secondly censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times. the long term political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemic related facts in china is yet to be seen. still the short term international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations. at the risk of quoting a cliché as well as the established streisand effect the truth always comes out no matter how many countries try to hide it. the spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures. research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early nineteenone8 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policies. to quote the results from this two thousand seven study consistent with this hypothesis cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates fifty percent lower than those that did not and had less steep epidemic curves. they also displayed lower cumulative mortality. one contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v. st. louis during the nineteenone8 influenza outbreak as one might guess philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings parades and social distancing measures whereas st. louis was not. from the same study we see the definition of a popular phrase flattening the curve emerging which is spreading out the rate of infection over time enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner in line with available resources. and to further corroborate this result the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the us. hence regardless of the multiple debunking claims of social distancing lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at flattening the curve . social distancing lockdown measures are effective only if sustained at least for a few months even after things start to improve. markel two thousand seven shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st. louis had on death rates during the spanish flu. the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu. two deaths due to the spanish flu in st. louis a wider picture. the black grey lines show the duration for which social distancing measures were active. another peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely. hence it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public damage caused to the economy due to such measures with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be eased. what can the industry learn the industry has played a key role in the obscure fight against the worldwide outbreak. but it faces its fair share of challenges in such unprecedented times. global industries have weathered through multiple natural disasters and two epidemics of a similar scale and nature. their recovery paths have immense strategic implications for current policy makers and offer strategic insights helping companies chart out their short term long term strategies. three this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in two00three the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in two0oneone and the mers epidemic in south korea in two0one.five three phases characterise the impact on the retail market in all these three cases the paths inevitably converge to stabilization but follow different trajectories and are swayed by public perceptions and externalities as in the case of the mid autumn festival in south korea. looking at the retail sector from a micro lens past crises show that demand trends vary amongst product categories both during and post the crisis. the three categories usually follow such trends demand trends during post a pandemic generated crisis four demand trends during post a pandemic generated crisis one these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden unexpected demands. a peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions across product categories fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers priority list. hence the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumer preferences in their products showcase product reliability quality and priced competitively given the prevalent context. lastly previous pandemics have consolidated a long standing theory which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumer centric industry that there is consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times. effective consumer relationship management crm can forge bonds that go a long way weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented times. implications almost two decades ago the sars outbreak in china had pushed entrepreneurs and established players to embrace the dawn of the e commerce era. this outbreak is expected to accelerate further the shift from conventional brick mortar based commerce to a centralized online cloud store based mechanism. survival in the fmcg sector at least will be decided to a great extent by the breadth of the supply chain networks and the ability to overcome severe bottlenecks. the past has shown that even though established large scale players with deep pockets and extensive networks have a likelier chance to tough it through these hard times even the regional players smes make it through strengthened by community support empathy and most importantly local relationships. what did we fail to learn this global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases. in the words of johan neyts professor of virology and president of the belgian based international society for antiviral research isar health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early two000s partly because of the economic crisis of two008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence. the way forward all of these lessons come with a caveat things change with time. the modes of communication have changed. both information travel is much more accessible now. we have fast planes faster internet. we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better if not perfect healthcare system. in nineteenone8 people didn t even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication. today we already have extensive research going on for seventy different probable vaccines for the virus with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvals. we are much better equipped than what we were one00 years ago and at the same time somewhat under equipped to deal with it. but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times and if put to good use can aid in the fight against covid nineteen. in the words of howard markel there s never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today with the exception of next week or a month later. you want to kick that can down the road but it s here today.,past prepared future speak world finds engulfed worst crises recent times global covid pandemic caused disruption public economic life factories shut supply chains

81,118,the current topic that is burning the world alive is the deadly coronavirus. let us first understand what this coronavirus actually is. according to the world health organization who the coronavirus disease which is called the covid nineteen is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. the covid nineteen virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways. the covid nineteen disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment. the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over sixty years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death. common symptoms include other symptoms include the people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should self isolate and contact their medical provider or a covid nineteen information line for advice on testing and referral. the people who have a fever cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention. some key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus in the last three months there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world. the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now. the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection. the deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes terrible illness and death but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons. some of them are as follows one. you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home. many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless. some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights being made to stay home. however when it comes to the greater good one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom. a balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever changing thing. trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public. two. you should wash your hands whether there s a virus or not general hygiene is always important. not just when there is a virus. you should know the drill by now. wet your hands. lather them with soap. scrub for two0 seconds. rinse off. dry with a clean towel. washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses. three. working from home should be an option for many in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home. most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely. without the virus in place there should still be some system in place that will promote work life balance. four. taking that sick day from the work could save lives if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation it is highly beneficial that you just stay home. it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days. many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers. this mentality needs to stop. if you are sick just stay home. five. the internet should be a basic right according to a study done by the university of birmingham the right to internet access also known as the right to broadband should be considered a human right. many people from all over the world are unable to get online particularly the people who live in developing countries and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives. in addition to this during times like these it is especially important to be able to contact family friends and work from home if necessary. the internet is the only way to do so. six. the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better if this scary time has taught us anything it s that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess. the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world. at the moment hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment. it is high time for us that we need to re evaluate how much money hollywood actors pro athletes and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve. seven. everyone should know how to cook the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn re learn or re ignite their love for cooking. learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life. you depend on yourself. it teaches you self sustainability and you save a lot of money. these days hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals. they are re discovering the wonders of eating in. eight. the importance of talking to friends every day now that we can t go out and keep busy the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family by chatting over the phone or video chatting. this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations. don t forget human connection during these crucial times. call your grandma nine. learn to appreciate nature if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe surface less space to take a walk in then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is. the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others. when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands. one0. learn how to be content alone it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing. being alone especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely. social distancing can be very difficult but it can also teach you a lot about yourself. you learn how to keep yourself busy. your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with it. conclusion it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past. the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it. these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be remembered by human beings in order to make the earth a beautiful place to live in. lastly i would like to conclude by mentioning that stay at home. stay safe. save lives .,current topic burning world alive deadly coronavirus understand coronavirus world health organization coronavirus disease called covid infectious disease caused newly discovered coronavirus

83,120,india has been beset by financial scams since independence. every four five years indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start. in this article with examples i would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like nirav modi the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like nirav modi. the first financial scam of independent india was found in one9five8 when feroze gandhi mp found that in one9five7 haridas mundhra got the government owned life insurance corporation lic to invest rs. twelve.four million about us dollar three.two million at the time in the shares of six troubled companies of whom mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market. the investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the lic s investment committee which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through. in the event lic lost most of the money. several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market as was claimed by the finance ministry and that had the lic consulted the investment committee they would have pointed out mundhra s forged shares episode from one9five6. the finance minister t. t. krishnamachari in his testimony tried to distance himself from the lic decision implying that it may have been taken by the finance secretary but justice m.c. chagla held that the minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions. eventually krishanamachari had to resign. the nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incident. the one99two indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by harshad mehta. the scam took place in mumbai and was the biggest market scam of india. the one99two scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the indian stock market to crash. the scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of india and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions. the one99two scam exposed the indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system. this scam led to the reform of the security system of india and introduced online security systems. the scam was orchestrated in such a way that mehta secured securities from the state bank of india against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and would go on to sell the stocks that he owned in these companies. the one99two scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with mehta. the one99two scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges. the security system of india took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the one99two scam. the first major structural change was the formation of the national stock exchange of india nse . the first major reform in the financial sector of india was the formation of the cii code for desirable corporate governance developed by rahul bajaj. post one99two a new regulatory board known as the securities and exchange board of india was formed to monitor the national stock exchange and the national securities depository. there were structural changes in the equity market. the government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market. the nse introduced online trading in one99four which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling. the capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in mumbai. the exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriers. in two00one ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors. this resulted in steep hikes in share prices. it later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices. this set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as k ten stocks and parekh was playfully referred to as pentafour . the rbi commenced an investigation against parekh. around the same time a bear cartel of brokers in mumbai opposed to parekh tried to dump their shares of k ten stocks. panicking parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so called k ten stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years. this resulted in a stock market crash the next day resulting in large scale losses for large institutional investors including insurance companies and mutual funds. a three0 member joint parliamentary committee jpc investigation ensued which found that parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companies. when the securities exchange board of india sebi started scanning an entire spectrum of ipos launched over two00three two00four and two00five it ended digging up more dirt and probably prevented a larger conspiracy to hijack the market. it involved the manipulation of the primary market read initial public offers ipos by financiers and market players by using fictitious or benaami demat accounts. they then transferred the shares to financiers who sold on the first day of listing making windfall gains from the price difference between the ipo price and the listing price. this time fraudsters targeted the primary market to make a quick buck at the expense of the gullible small investors. direct participants dps used retail applicants shares for reaping benefits in the stock market. the two0ten fake housing loan in india was uncovered by the central bureau of investigation cbi in india. cbi arrested eight top ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions including the lic housing finance ceo ramchandran nair in connection with the scam. cbi alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions. the bank officials sanctioned large scale corporate loans to realty developers overriding mandatory conditions for such approvals along with other irregularities. the thane police struggling to crack down on the tax refund scam that has taken the income tax department for a ride and defrauded the central exchequer of around rs three crore has concluded that the scam involved high ranking officials from the i t department and the state bank of india. the fraud involving two i t offices in thane and kalyan was planned by those familiar with the i t office functioning. for over two years two007 two008 and two008 two009 the i t officials disbursed tax refund cheques drawn from the sbi and credited into the account of fictitious assessees in a credit society in dombivli. as many as threethreeone such tax refund cheques some exceeding rs one lakh were subsequently routed to the dombivli nagri cooperative bank and funds withdrawn. the i t refunds are account payee cheques which can t be transferred. despite this all threethreeone refund orders were credited to the third party account of a credit society. the saradha group financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal caused by the collapse of a ponzi scheme run by saradha group a consortium of over two00 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in eastern india. it was feared that legitimate non banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust higher interest rates lower lending and a localized credit crisis. because most of the saradha group depositors came from the lowest economic strata the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. the scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilizing companies which are facing increased regulatory pressure. many of these companies have been variations of timeshare travel schemes of which there are few clear regulations. in august two0onethree the central government amended the sebi act and gave sebi powers to search and seize without prior magisterial permission to investigate illegal money collection schemes. nsel case relates to a payment default at the national spot exchange limited that occurred in two0onethree involving financial technologies india ltd when a payment default took place after a commodities market regulator the forward markets commission fmc directed nsel to stop launching contracts. this led to the closure of the exchange in july two0onethree. three spot exchanges nsel nspot and national apmc were exempted by the government under section two7 of fcra to conduct forward trading in one day contracts. this was done to boost volumes so that their economic viability improved. on the flawed recommendations of the fmc the ministry of consumer affairs ordered nsel to settle all existing contracts and not launch any fresh contracts which led to the crisis. investigations led by enforcement directorate ed and economic offences wing eow revealed the role of brokers and defaulters in the nsel case. the brokers mis sold nsel products to their clients by assuring them of fixed returns. the defaulters hypothecated stocks and produced fake warehouse receipts and siphoned the entire default money. fiu under finance ministry held that nsel came under the purview of the forwarding contracts regulation act fcra and therefore guilty of failing in several of these obligations under the law. the black money watchdog has slapped a penalty of rs one.sixty six crore for several counts of violating the provisions of the prevention of money laundering act pmla on nsel. the watchdog further held that failures are deliberate and willful and hence invite penalties. the nse co location scam relates to the market manipulation at the national stock exchange of india india s leading stock exchange. allegedly select players obtained market price information ahead of the rest of the market enabling them to front run the rest of the market possibly breaching the nse s purpose of demutualization exchange governance and its robust transparency based mechanism. he alleged connivance of insiders by rigging nse s algo trading and use of co location servers ensured substantial profits to a set of brokers. the whistle blower alleged that trading members were able to capitalize on advanced knowledge by colluding with some exchange officials. in a written reply minister of state for finance arjun meghwal told the lok sabha in two0one6 the architecture of nse with respect to dissemination of tick by tick through transmission control protocol tcp or internet protocol ip was prone to manipulation or market abuse. the punjab national bank fraud case relates to the fraudulent letters of undertaking worth rupee oneone threefive6.8four crores us dollar one.four billion issued by the punjab national bank at its brady house branch in fort mumbai making punjab national bank liable for the amount. the fraud was allegedly organized by jeweler and designer nirav modi. nirav his wife ami modi brother nishal modi and uncle mehul choksi all partners of the firms m s diamond r us m s solar exports and m s stellar diamonds along with pnb officials and employees and directors of nirav modi and mehul choksi s firms have all been named in a charge sheet by the cbi. the bank initially said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam as the bank s core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued lous to overseas branches of other indian banks including allahabad bank axis bank and union bank of india using the international financial communication system swift. on one march two0one8 the government approved the fugitive economic offenders bill to deter economic offenders from evading the process of indian law by giving powers to the government to confiscate assets of a fugitive including benami assets of absconding loan defaulters. the bill covers a wide range of economic offenders which include loan defaulters fraudsters individuals who violate laws governing taxes black money benami properties the financial sector and corruption. in march two0one8 the reserve bank of india scrapped banking instruments such as the letter of understanding lou and letter of comfort loc that in an attempt to plug a loophole and improve banks due diligence in trade credit. some bankers said that lous and locs led to receiving banks depending completely on the issuing bank on creditworthiness. as seen in all the above cases for scams like nirav modi the two factors action taken by the insiders or systemic loopholes were responsible for the majority of the indian financial scams. the improvement in the industry will only come when all the loopholes are closed down and accountability is given and held to all the people working in the industry.,beset financial scams independence

84,121,it was 14th march and i was altogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year. i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me. in the morning i made some last minute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market. it was not like i wasn t aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because there s a quote in theatre that says fear is only as deep as the mind allows and to some length i was fearless. my passion fondness and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that we re rolling out. but then at once i received a call from mr. sandeep the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen. the competition was postponed the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus. these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness. this very sickness acted like a sadist. i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me. it has reversed the ways we used to work play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing. this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well. the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent. also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier intolerant and non supportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist. but by all means our government knows how to best handle the affairs they decided to shut down schools colleges bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than ten people. with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home. this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other country related issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problem. with fake news traveling around the world people come and start to blabber. people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it. they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic. some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments. but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still. the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful people. but one thing that can t be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game. the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than seventy five million. many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue. one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job. who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many people. massive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus this statement takes my immediate attention. what options are left with the daily wage earners i would say no option. they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations. lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke but lockdown for them means an end to their life. unquestionably this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think it s a moment to question. going to the internet and writing what s the best way to spend this quarantine should definitely be what s the best way in which we can help people but naturally this would not interest many people. furthermore this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling. unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hunger. my maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem. she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like. mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses. what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables. a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in two days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it. not only mala and her family but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition. there are countless mala in our country who are panicking enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs. imagine an exact same situation for yourselves it would without fail be the hardest situation. this is the impact a virus can create. for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to to this and each story is painful that the other. labor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help. this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work. quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates. a very known movie in our indian cinemas is coolie that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up. these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will. these stories will never end because it s all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to them. also how one would imagine that the movie six feet s apart would be acted in reality. the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers round the clock. solutions like washing your hands for at least two0 seconds correctly covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow. the efforts of our doctors nurses government officials made me realize that my passion should not be above these notices and announcements but should move hand in hand with it. right at this moment we all are moving with these circumstances and nobody knows what might happen in the future but one thing is of sure that nobody can ever forget this situation and indeed me as it had the ability to knock down my event that day. many lessons were learned by all the world in these days some being that never ever take anything for granted because if that thing or that person leaves then life tends to become like a rock. appreciate admire and cherish whatever you have because you never know when it might leave you ask from them who have just lost someone from this corona virus. moments to live happily in this world are very few spend it with someone who makes you feel loved. each day sun rises with a new hope to make a habit to feel the warmth and wish for a healthy life for yourself your family and this world. together we all are fighting this virus with unity.,14th altogether prepared theater competition knew competition meant morning made minute calls diligent team ceaselessly practicing past days

85,122,nathan wolfe impact once said there are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur and what we can learn from them. one commonality is that it comes from animals and the other one is that we wait too long. in the year one thousand seven hundred twenty plague in the year one thousand eight hundred twenty cholera outbreak and the most recent pandemic was the spanish flu of one thousand nine hundred twenty. the researchers said that all of these pandemics above have exactly the same pattern as the coronavirus outbreak. however the precision with which these pandemics occur at exactly one hundred years of age makes us think better about this topic. coronavirus disease covid nineteen is one such infectious disease that has been declared a global pandemic by who. most people infected with the covid nineteen virus experience mild to moderate illness and recover without requiring special treatment. older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the covid nineteen virus the disease it causes and how it spreads. people can protect themselves and others from infection by washing their hands or using an alcohol based sanitizer frequently and by not touching their face. the covid nineteen virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes so it s important that you also practice respiratory etiquettes for example by coughing into a flexed elbow etc . at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid nineteen. however there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. the first case of this pandemic in india was reported on january threeth two thousand twenty. after which it has increased substantially around the country to such an extent that the indian prime minister announced a twenty one day lockdown around the country. rating agencies both global and domestic are unanimous that the covid nineteen pandemic will be an economic tsunami for india. even though the country may not slip into a recession unlike the eurozone the us or asia pacific that have stronger trade ties to china analysts believe the impact on india s gdp growth will be significant. the fallout of the move will spill over to the financial year twotwenty one which begins on april one. moody s investors service on march twenty seven sharply slashed its projection for india s gdp growth in the calendar year two thousand twenty from five.three percent to two.five percent . the markdown was the second in one days and came after prime minister narendra modi announced the twenty one day lockdown. in its global macro outlook two thousand twenty twenty one moody s cited severe liquidity constraints in india s banking and non banking sectors as a hindrance to growth. the agency s forecast for the global economy was even more stark a contraction of .five percent in the ongoing financial year. lower business volumes and occupancies and sub optimal efficiencies will impact the profitability of companies. while some affected companies may initiate cost curtailment measures these may not be enough given their high fixed costs. that could impair their credit files says subodh rai senior director crisil. neeraj kumar a migrant worker decided to flee. he and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the lockdown announcement was made. public transport systems were stopped leaving people with no choice but to walk. mr. kumar his wife and their one year old daughter had already walked more than fourkm twofour miles when we spoke to him. there is no work here that is why we are running away. there are no buses i have to walk another two6km to get to my village he said. the situation of workers following the lockdown is no better. mohammad alam is one of the thousands of workers standing in a food queue in india s capital delhi. the factory where he worked has shut down after prime minister narendra modi announced a twenty one day lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. a daily wage laborer he has no other source of income so he has been forced to come to a government center for food. i don t know how i will survive i will have to borrow to feed my family he says. india has announced a dollar twothreebn oneeightbn relief package to help people like mr. alam and mr. kumar who are part of india s unorganized informal industry that employs ninety four percent of the population and contributes fourfive percent to its overall output. this industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands of finding themselves unemployed overnight. no one will be allowed to go hungry finance minister nirmala sitharaman said while announcing the package a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures. but the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire. businesses have closed unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen. india s growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of the outbreak arrived. once one of the fastest growing economies in the world its growth slowed to four.seven percent last year the lowest level in six years. unemployment was at a fourfive year high last year. the industrial output from the eight core sectors at the end of last year fell by five.two percent the worst in onefour years. small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial twoone6 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash consuming informal economy. now experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy. there is little finance minister nirmala sitharaman and rbi governor shatikanta das can do if covid nineteen forces a virtual lockdown of commercial hubs in india like it had done in china and has in italy. lights out in mumbai and delhi alone the nerve centers of india will cause great damage to the indian economy. indeed covid nineteen can be a massive blow to the slowing indian economy particularly small business the sme sector which had recently shown improvement since demonetization took place. this is a war like situation for the indian economy as the malls and theatres are empty. schools are shut for contingencies and some states have even announced a complete shutdown of all services. so while most welcome the government s measures they feel much more is needed to be done to minimize the economic impact. while free extra rations have been sanctioned how will the poor access what is due to them wonders economist arun kumar. the government should devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute food to the poor. with thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from their homes the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the government s top priority he adds. and it s not just migrant workers at risk. farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown the agriculture industry contributes nearly dollar two6fivebn to gdp. the government says it will give farmers two rupees dollar three in april as an advance payment from an dollar eight annual pay out to tide over the situation. this money will be inadequate because exports have stopped. prices in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop because farmers won t be able to sell their crop says economist arun kumar. the outbreak has happened at a critical farming time the new crop is ready waiting to be sold. economists warn india s challenge will be in transporting this food from villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown. if supply chains don t work properly a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for indian farmers. experts warn that india is also at the brink of a major unemployment crisis. economist vivek kaul says people who work for small businesses may end up with job and salary losses. i know of places where companies are actively discussing how many people they need to fire he says and that s not all. while no sector is immune to covid nineteen disruption some are more vulnerable. the tourism industry will see greater disruptions. the world travel and tourism council calculated that tourism generated nine.two percent of the gdp and supported fourtwo.6seventhree million jobs. tourism dependent states like kerala karnataka earn huge forex but if the disease continues many operators will be forced to go out of the business. in the exports industry while the gloom and doom surrounding covid nineteen are palpable the crisis might also throw up some great opportunities for india. there are already reports of several western manufacturers looking at moving their factories out of china. many indian chemical producers have gone on record at having received inquiries from western manufacturers who earlier never used to look towards india as a source. tapping these opportunities however will require some serious innovation on the policy front. indian policymakers need to hunker down and plan economic assistance that will not only help india s export sector survive the immediate crisis but also retain stability and resume growth in the medium to long term. with flights suspended until mid april the shutdown is also bound to push india s fast growing aviation industry into peril. the centre for asia pacific aviation capa has assessed that the indian aviation industry will post losses worth nearly dollar fourbn this year. this will likely have a cascading effect affecting the hospitality and tourism industries. hotels and restaurant chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several months sparking worries of large scale layoffs. the automobile industry a key indicator of a country s economic growth has also been forced to hit the brakes experts are estimating losses of nearly dollar twobn. so is india s relief package enough experts say it s a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the us china and singapore the stimulus package constituting about .eight percent of fytwo gdp is not at par to address the urgent needs of smaller businesses. experts say that india definitely needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses this extraordinary crisis. desperate times call for desperate measures. india has done well in containing this dangerous virus but should act swiftly and decisively to protect its economy. clearly there is a need for greater fiscal monetary coordination to ensure an optimal policy response.,impact commonalities pandemics occur learn commonality animals wait plague cholera outbreak recent pandemic spanish flu researchers pandemics pattern

86,123,introduction coronavirus disease covid nineteen is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. most people infected with this covid nineteen virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory disease and recover without requiring special treatment. older age people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is well informed about the covid nineteen virus the disease it causes and how it spreads. protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. the covid nineteen virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person suffering from coughs or sneezes so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette for example by coughing into a flexed elbow . at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for this virus. however there are many ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments. which will continue to provide regular basis information as soon as clinical findings become available impact the emergence of covid nineteen is a tragic public health emergency. the disease one hopes will be brought under control quickly but the international monetary fund is already warning that economic growth in china may slow. as we watch the situation unfold three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear. the first risk is obviously in china itself. while the precise origins of the disease remain unclear it is hard to take a definite view on whether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided for example by better control over hygiene in food markets. but it is painfully obvious that a lack of transparency in china has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around the world. as financial markets go down in two thousand seven two thousand eight when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood people tend to assume the worse. rapidly falling asset prices may not contain much information except that there is not much information to be had. the chinese authorities surely do not have all the answers at this point but their inclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpful. second the lack of american leadership is more painfully apparent every day. the united states has the strongest medical health system and facilities in the world with the capacity for research and development government and private that is second to none. yet president donald trump s administration seems to be concerned primarily with playing down the risks while keeping the virus out of the united states of america a nearly impossible task. the private sector is working hard on a vaccine and this is commendable. unfortunately over a longer period of time the lack of a consistent market for such vaccines has undermined investment in this sector. by creating the world s largest market for many drugs the us effectively supports research across a wide range of ailments but only those for which there is large and steady demand in the us. even the most fervent believer in trump s america first must be willing to concede that it is not in america s interest for the rest of the world to become sick. these are us allies friends and customers. also like it or not few diseases will stop at america s borders. indeed the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc has said that the question is not if but rather when covid nineteen spreads domestically. the third risk is in emerging markets and developing countries. poorer countries are ill equipped to deal with this kind of disease as seen in african countries refusal to airlift their citizens from china. the news that the coronavirus has reached italy has shaken world financial markets but italy is a relatively well organized and rich country. a vibrant democracy ensures that people will quickly understand if containment and treatment measures are working. we should be much more concerned about other countries where nutrition is worse housing standards are weak and disease transmission can occur much more readily. if these countries health systems come under pressure the us europe and others should step up quickly with technical assistance and essential supplies. but here too there is so far a worrying lack of leadership. it seems unlikely that this disease will prove to be as deadly as some of those that our ancestors experienced. medical practice and public health have advanced a great deal. the cdc is an outstanding organization and the world health organization has a strong track record when the chips are down. private sector groups of dedicated doctors and nurses have performed extraordinarily well under the most difficult circumstances such as dealing with ebola when they are given a chance. we are fortunate to live in an age that has so many heroic people. still this coronavirus is a warning. societies neglect access to health care systems and reduce investments in research and development at great peril. diseases are always evolving and we must continually increase our capacity to understand and fight newly emerging threats. the best way forward is by strengthening science training more scientists and building more labs. countries that are able to do this like the us should share ideas and knowledge as widely as possible. investing more in science is an appealing economic proposition. given very high rates of social return basic research across a wide range of activities more than pays for itself but this is not about economics. more likely than not one day a scientist will save your life or the life of a loved one because his or her previous work produced a drug treatment or just an idea that made a critical difference. we should invest in scientists to save ourselves and our neighbors. also we must remember that we have neighbors all over our deeply interconnected world. global shares take a hit big shifts in stock markets where shares in companies are bought and sold can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts isas . the ftse dow jones industrial average and the nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on thirty one december. the dow and the ftse recently saw their biggest one day declines since nineteen87. investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline. in response central banks in many countries including the united kingdom have slashed interest rates. that should in theory make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. global markets did also recover some ground after the us senate passed a dollar two trillion one.7tn coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses. but some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is contained. indian economy india faces a sharp decline in government revenues and economic growth for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity and a fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans government and industry sources said. officially the government is still sticking to the target of achieving six six.five percent in the next financial year beginning april while hoping that a fall in crude oil prices could help it garner more revenue and contain a fall in revenue from other sectors but economists and bankers are turning increasingly downbeat about india s economic prospects especially as the government is betting on filling its coffers through ill timed asset sales. we are going to miss the revised revenue targets for the current fiscal year and will have to lower next year s targets as well said a senior government official with direct knowledge of budget estimates. he said receipts from much delayed privatization of india s second biggest oil refiner bharat petroleum corp could be lower by at least dollar two billion against initial estimates. the company s share prices have fallen by over two7 percent since january while the broader nse nifty five0 index has fallen by nearly two0 percent following a panic in global markets. on wednesday the government suspended almost all visas to the country till april onefive to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across the region continue to rise. total cases in the country rose to seventy three on thursday according to the government. another senior finance ministry official said some of the proposed share shale plans in companies like coal india steel authority of india ltd sail nmdc and ircon have been deferred. the government now expects to raise about rs five0 crore dollar six.7five billion against the downwardly revised target of rs sixfive crore for the ongoing financial year ending in march the official said. another senior official in the tax department said receipts have been hit due to a fall in consumer demand as reflected in the lower sales of autos passenger traffic hotel bookings and retail sales. tour operators estimate january march quarter earnings could fall by more than six0 percent from a year ago as hundreds of thousands of tourists cancel travel hitting hotels airlines and tax collection for the federal and state governments. india attracts nearly one million foreign tourists a month and the travel restrictions could impact for the next few months. the situation in india was still far better compared to some other countries hit by a global pandemic sarkar said. india annually earns nearly dollar thirty billion from foreign tourist arrivals and the industry is worried that a global spread of the virus will harm already weakened economic growth. as this situation will take time to recover and economy not only of india but globally is in a recession it up to government how they come up with their measure. if we look at recent action of us fed and other countries step it took a thought that this pressure is deeper than it looks like and this situation is very different than that happen in two thousand eight crisis or that in nineteen98 as that time none of the factories are closed but this time work has been stoped and more importantly economy from past one year is facing slow down in many sectors so this will impact small companies badly. but if we think in another way there will be a shift in a lot of pattern like people will now go for short term investment in the stock market due to uncertainty of life insurance stocks will be benefited logistics distribution network will totally change as factories will now try to procure material from nearest location and there will be an increase in the personal saving of people because of which automakers and real estate sector may be hit hard. if we estimate it will take around one year to get back in a track from now and all this will happen if the government and central bank continuously come up with relief measure,introduction coronavirus

87,124,from the economic point of view india is confronted today with perhaps its greatest emergency since independence. the global financial crisis in two thousand eight nine was a gigantic demand shock but our workers could still get up and go to work our firms were coming off years of steady growth our financial system was largely sound and our government finances were blooming. none of this is true today as we fight the coronavirus pandemic. yet there is also no reason to despair. with the right undertakings and priorities and drawing on india s many sources of strength it can kill this virus back and even set the stage for a much more hopeful tomorrow. the rampant spread of covid nineteen outbreak across borders and geographies has severely impacted almost the whole world and triggered significant downside risks to the overall global economic outlook. steps taken to contain its spread such as the nationwide lockdown announced by the indian government have brought economic activity to a near standstill with impacts on both consumption and investment. india s real gdp growth decelerated to its lowest in over six years in threeq two0nineteen two thousand twenty and the outbreak of covid nineteen posted fresh challenges. for most businesses the slowdown could be in the form of supply disruptions fall in consumption demand and stress on the banking and financial sectors. in sum the three major contributors to gdp will all get affected i.e. private consumption investment and external trade. figure one.one showing quarterly growth in gdp in percent . source mospi assessing the exact impact for india is hard with uncertainty on how long the pandemic would last. three likely scenarios for india s economic situation could be figure one.two showing an optimistic situation. source deloitte figure one.three showing an optimistic scenario with a severe and extended impact of covid nineteen. source deloitte in scenario two inflation picks up in htwo fy two0twoone as demand revives faster than supply. inflation may increase above the target range four percent for a short time in fy two0twoone because of economic overheating. in this scenario inflation remains three four percent during this period despite weak demand because of a sharper fall in production. figure one.four showing pessimistic situation with a prolonged severe downturn. source deloitte. impact on the demand side impact on the supply side figure one.five showing supply chain disruptions. source the economic times. what has been done so far india has already undertaken the following measures to counter the impact from of the pandemic what can the corporates do the crisis is a story with an uncertain ending. however what is clear that the covid nineteen has introduced new challenges to the business environment which called for a measured practical and informed approach from political and business leaders. a company needs to think and act across five horizons figure one.six showing the crisis as a lesson to businessmen in assessing risk to their business. source the economic times collectively these five stages epitomize the inescapable of our time the battle against covid nineteen is one that leaders today must win in order to find an economically and socially feasible path to the next normal. what can the government do the government should consider certain measures in order to manage the pandemic. the following steps and the recognition of the likely scenarios for the indian economy can enable policymakers to identify appropriate countermeasures to stem the spread of the pandemic therefore the question remains whether the stimulus is enough or not both quantitatively and qualitatively would it be able to help the economy absorb the shock of the lockdown compared to what the usa two trillion usd germany sixone0 billion usd uk fourtwofour billion usd france threethreefive billion usd spain twooneeight billion usd china seventy eight.eight billion usd and italy two7.three billion usd the spending by india one seventy crore twotwo.five billion usd may prima facie appear to be insufficient. however such a comparison is not easy and straightforward because a lot of factors are to be taken into account. in addition the important factor that needs to be considered is whether at this point in time the country is able to spend more than this or not. against a revised budget estimate of rs. twoone sixthree crore for two0nineteen two0 towards tax collections the collection as on threeonest dec two0nineteen was to the tune of rs. onethree eightthree crore only with a clearly huge shortfall. in addition a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to tackle the pandemic which is of utmost priority. on top of it huge additional spending would jeopardize the fiscal deficit discipline although at times of emergency fiscal deficit should not be a matter of concern at all. it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have the virus continues to affect us beyond three months and extends to six eight months quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy. if the need arises currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat. the corporate sector and a section of large hearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the government. the pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception. there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future. whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen. we will have to take care of our lives as well as the livelihoods of our citizens. as indians we hope we shall overcome. together we can do this and we will.,economic point view confronted today greatest emergency independence global financial crisis gigantic demand shock workers work

88,125,in today s day and age of hyper connectivity celebrities dubbed by fraser and brown two thousand two as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public. notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up what they wear to the gym what they eat and where they go on their vacations. in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities this unceasing visibility gives them an all pervasive influence. the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well established from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums brand endorsements and integrations the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast. however today more than ever before this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance policy and politics. with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances making moves charged with a political motive and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to thereby begging the question how well placed are personage in the world of politics should celebrities be allowed to join politics the interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy makers have come into increasing contact in india and the rest of the world leading pop music artists back presidential candidates internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars and so on. the influence that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils to represent the public that they once only influenced. although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20th century choi and berger two thousand one suggest that the celebrity politics connect continues to strengthen much more than it did a few decades ago as we trudge further into the century. of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance the global internet where fame isn t restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver. in her two thousand nine book hyde labels this spectacle as a mission creep where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals. a prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics. celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace having already learned to live in the public s eye and established themselves allowing the carry over of their already known traits as celebrities into their role as policy makers. the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere. in one of the best known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house carrying with him his trademark charismatic on screen personality that spilled over into his politics. initially serving as the governor of california for fifteen years in the late 1960s reagan served two terms at the oval office. the voters knew who ronald was those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue but also those who did not giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success. on the other side of the globe india saw much the same trend as an on screen persona aiding the creation of an off screen political career. ramanand sagar s television series ramayan based on the hindu mythological epic was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel. it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen every time arun govil who portrayed the deity ram made an appearance on screen. having garnered a devout dutiful fan following govil and his other co actors from the show turned to the world of politics where their godly association in the public s eyes helped them make a mark. even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity that their opponents lack. very often the sentiment of anti incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians. indeed various political theorists suggest that anti incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks. until 31st december two thousand eighteen ukrainian actor screenwriter and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president. it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to change the mood and timbre of the political establishment and to bring professional decent people to power . zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real as he crushed rival a seasoned politician and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory. has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor time is yet to deliver its verdict. but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine and his plea to oust the ruling class played their role in assuring zelensky seventy three percent of the plebiscite. in the early 2010s in india similar anti incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani hockey legend dhanraj pillay singer jaspinder narula and others all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwal s aam aadmi movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills. and so innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne. in fact a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor politician spanning the atlas claims that it may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics. this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics. in a research article published in one thousand nine hundred ninety five meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular thereby failing to make any appreciable difference. this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark. one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir a cricketer turned politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament. hema malini another popular actress who turned to politics came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of women s rights wasn t backed by an effort to fulfill her promises. owing to such instances research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt two thousand sixteen find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics. it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver celebrity politicians often deprive grass root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics. however there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can in fact make their mark in the world of governance independent of their primary identities. take the south indian state of tamil nadu for instance where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz for at least the last forty years. as per data from the ministry of statistics programme implementation tamil nadu is amongst the top performing states in the country having the second highest gdp. most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber. the late actor politician j. jayalalithaa or amma ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers. another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu dr. mg ramachandran continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large scale reforms. in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress including easing caste tensions and other communal violence mgr as he is better known is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen. more often than not celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population. empirical studies such as the one by austin vord pinkleton and epstein two thousand eight have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters. along similar lines jackson two thousand eight found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians. in fact many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic to be active participants in democracy. hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboard topping artists beyonce and jay z to take center stage at her rally in cleveland in the weeks leading up to the two thousand sixteen us presidential elections in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters. in such a case it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth. from our vantage point today the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay. what remains to be done however is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve. yet it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people celebrity or not but in the world that we live in this is certainly not the case. politicians celebrity or not largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job. ultimately like all things in democracy the government is of the people and its representatives are of them and for them. the eventual endorsement of its leaders celebrity or not can come not from data based analyses and elaborate critique but from the people. should celebrities be allowed to enter politics the question remains unanswered. or rather is answered by the democratic exercise itself with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election when the people the real influencers choose.,today age hyper connectivity celebrities dubbed people famous famous serve sacrificially live houses open prying eyes public notification bars abuzz news celebrities wake wear gym eat vacations idealized idolized eyes society views

89,126,frankly no the state of the public healthcare system still vast is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid nineteen. the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india. from the nineteen60s onwards the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india. the healthcare system is organized into primary secondary and tertiary levels. at the primary level are sub centre s and primary health centre s phcs . at the secondary level there are community health centre s chcs and smaller sub district hospitals. finally the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level which consists of medical colleges and district general hospitals. the number of phcs chcs sub centre s and district hospitals has increased in the past six years although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards. but there are still critical challenges to the existing system. one of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases especially communicable diseases among the general population of india. this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society especially poor households migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts. add low educational status poor functional literacy low accent on education within the healthcare system and low priority for health in the population among others and you see the magnitude of the problem. according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iit hyderabad and iit bombay in tier one cities it was found that about onetwo percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid nineteen. this modal shift was about nine percent in tier two cities and about seven percent in tier three cities. moreover nearly forty eight percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march whereas two8 percent had the same frequency of travel to work. when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation around one8 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas two0 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys. this indicates that awareness about covid nineteen is higher in tier one cities in comparison with tier two and tier three cities. but national level state level and door to door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace. the second challenge is access to public healthcare in india. access to healthcare is defined by the oxford dictionary as the right or opportunity to use or benefit from healthcare physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access defined as the ability to enter a healthcare facility within five km from the place of residence or work . using this definition a study in india in two0onetwo found that in rural areas only threeseven percent of people were able to access ip facilities within a five km distance and sixty eight percent were able to access out patient facilities. furthermore it was postulated that in general the more rustic rural one s existence the further one lives from towns the greater are the odds of disease malnourishment weakness and premature death. the third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic. planning for a pandemic such as covid nineteen has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations which about a quarter of the population live in. the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers an important part of the indian economy who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages. the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals who are fighting in the front of this pandemic of lack of protective personal equipment s ppe s to protect themselves and their patients from covid nineteen. the lockdown has hit hiv and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition. elderly people who are often alone and have medical conditions have been left without essential support. ironically these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid nineteen. i am optimistically hoping based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today.,frankly public healthcare system vast fragmented scale rapidly face challenge pandemic covid origin public healthcare lies colonial period

90,127,every prophet of doom unless he also happens to be a psychopath hopes that his predictions will not be borne out. this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sars cov two virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world. the name coronavirus itself is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game. tracing back the origins of the now pandemic we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan a city of eleven million people in china s hubei province in late twonineteen. cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february the peak of the epidemic there. the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over twoonefour countries around the globe. besides being a health crisis the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirus induced global downturn to be way worse than financial crisis. as the coronavirus spreads across the globe it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time economic inequality. research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices. according to the international labour organization ilo covid nineteen will have far reaching impacts on labor market outcomes. beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions. initial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus. based on different scenarios for the impact of covid nineteen on global gdp growth preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between five.three million low scenario and twofour.seven million high scenario from a base level of one hundred eighty eight million in twonineteen. the mid scenario suggests an increase of onethree million seven.four million in high income countries . though these estimates remain highly uncertain all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment. for comparison the global financial crisis of twoeight nine increased unemployment by twotwo million. while self employment does not typically react to economic downturns it acts as a default option for survival or maintaining income often in the informal economy. for this reason informal employment tends to increase during crises. however the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism. labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity. at this point a preliminary estimate suggests that infected workers have already lost nearly three work months with the consequent loss of income for unprotected workers . employment impacts imply large income losses for workers. overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between eight hundred sixty and three fourfour billion usd. the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient. working poverty is also likely to increase significantly. the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line. the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional eight.eight million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated i.e. an overall decline of five.two million working poor in twotwo compared to a decline of onefour million estimated pre covid nineteen . under the mid and high scenarios there will be between two.one million and threefive. million more people in working poverty than before the pre covid nineteen estimate for twotwo. who are particularly vulnerable epidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population which can trigger worsening inequality. based on past experience and current information on the covid nineteen pandemic and insights from previous crises a number of groups can be identified the extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the world s most vulnerable people including the world of work. the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries where the most known cases are concentrated. experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low income countries to address the pandemic. covid nineteen cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under detected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic. countries with large poor populations including brazil india indonesia nigeria and pakistan have confirmed few cases but have been slow to respond to the threat according to npr. preventative care and health education are less accessible to low income people who are more likely to have pre existing conditions catch covid nineteen and die from it. people living in poverty are also more likely to hold insecure jobs and cannot afford to stay home sick from work. in times of crisis international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid nineteen on the world of work. these standards adopted by representatives of governments workers and employers organizations provide a human centered approach to growth and development including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises. policy responses should focus on two immediate goals health protection measures and economic support on both the demand and supply side of the associated cause. in such challenging times many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars protecting workers in the workplace stimulating the economy and labor demand and supporting employment and income. some of the policies include working arrangements including telework occupational safety and health osh advice expanded access to paid sick leave prevention of discrimination and exclusion. while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery it is clear that more needs to be done. past crises and the experiences of countries which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid nineteen crisis show that preparedness and early action is critical. the coronavirus pandemic is a test. it s a test of medical capacity and political will. it s a test of endurance and forbearance for believers a test of religious faith. it s a test too of a different kind of faith in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior. the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence questions so profound that they have previously been answered in many different ways by the greatest philosophers. it s a test of where all humans stand. what is right and what is wrong what can individuals expect from society and what can society expect of them should others make sacrifices for me and vice versa is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease how long will we stay that way and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potent.at last i would like to conclude by saying that covid nineteen is something we all face as a community and thus something that we have to solve as a community not with weapons but with goodwill and common efforts.,prophet doom psychopath hopes predictions borne epidemiologists virologists warning world sars cov virus poses severe threat public health world

92,129,before jumping on the topic i would like to give an overview of what is coronavirus covid nineteen how it spreads and its symptoms. waitresses hotel housekeepers and casino dealers are among the more than fifteen million hospitality jobs in u.s. cities at risk from restrictions being put in place to deal with the spread of covid nineteen. bureau of labor statistics data through may two thousand eighteen covering forty occupations critical to america s hospitality and gaming industries. hospitality workers as a share of each metro area s workforce circles sized by total hospitality jobs . as of twenty april twentytwenty at least twenty three states have closed bars or restaurants around twenty have prohibited gatherings of more than fifty people and several have begun implementing curfews and shuttering non essential businesses. the most extreme measures have occurred in california where a shelter in place directive was announced by gov. gavin newsom on thursday. the order requires forty million california residents to remain at home except for essential activities or jobs. in addition to critical government and healthcare roles cafes and restaurants are allowed to stay open but only for take out or delivery which has already led to mass layoffs. nowhere are there more threatened jobs than in the new york metro area where one million people work in hospitality. this includes fifteen7 waiters and waitresses forty bartenders and eight fifty0 hotel desk clerks. on twenty april twentytwenty gov. andrew cuomo ordered all non essential workers to remain at home for the foreseeable future. the los angeles area has the second most such workers around eight00 including twenty two people who work at amusement parks and recreation facilities. this represents between eleven percent to thirteen percent of these cities respective workforces in recent years. most hospitality jobs there are four.six million hospitality workers in the top city clusters the pain of an extensive and prolonged coronavirus related shutdown will be especially felt in the nation s tourism hotspots. roughly one in four workers in beach destinations like kahului on the island of maui in hawaii and myrtle beach south carolina are employed in the hospitality sector. the same goes for gambling towns like atlantic city and las vegas where the governor of nevada recently announced a thirty day shutdown of all casinos. the hospitality industry matters most in beach and gambling destinations all but five of the forty occupations in this analysis fall into broad categories that were less likely than the workforce overall to work from home on average in two thousand eighteen according to the bls american time use survey. additionally seventeen of the roles including restaurant wait staff and table game dealers require at least arm s length contact with others based on physical proximity scores compiled by the o net database of occupational information. at a time when most major cities are urging residents to stay at home and practice social distancing few jobs are more at risk than these.,jumping topic give overview coronavirus covid spreads symptoms waitresses hotel housekeepers casino dealers hospitality jobs us cities risk restrictions put spread covid bureau labor statistics data covering occupations critical hospitality gaming industries hospitality workers share metro area workforce circles sized total hospitality jobs twentytwenty states closed bars restaurants prohibited gatherings people begun implementing curfews shuttering essential businesses extreme measures occurred shelter directive announced gov order requires residents remain home essential activities jobs addition critical government healthcare roles cafes restaurants allowed stay open delivery led mass layoffs threatened jobs metro area people work hospitality includes fifteen7 waiters waitresses bartenders fifty0 hotel desk clerks twentytwenty gov ordered essential workers remain home foreseeable future area workers eight00 including people work amusement recreation facilities represents percent percent cities respective workforces recent years hospitality jobs foursix hospitality workers top clusters pain extensive prolonged coronavirus related shutdown felt tourism hotspots roughly workers destinations kahului maui employed hospitality sector gambling governor recently announced shutdown casinos hospitality industry matters gambling destinations occupations analysis fall broad categories workforce work home average bls time survey additionally roles including restaurant wait staff table game dealers require arm length contact based physical proximity scores compiled net database occupational information time cities urging residents stay home practice social distancing jobs risk
93,130,as the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures energy supply and demand is being disrupted. the impact that country wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day. impact on energy markets are i slump in wind expansion may support german power prices the recent slump in german wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology. this has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output impacting supply and in turn supporting power prices. ii chinese industrial gas demand remains weak in march chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in march was down by almost twenty five percent year on year according to the chongqing gas and petroleum exchange released over easter as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption. iii reduced energy offtake likely to hit uk suppliers a growing number of british energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing through reduced energy offtake and cash flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic according to industry sources polled by icis. iv breakdown of european power demand impact power consumption continued to soften across key european demand centres through march and the first week of april while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of europe. v brexit set to ensure eu two thousand twenty renewable goals while the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the european renewables sector one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the achievement of eu and member state binding renewable energy targets for two thousand twenty. this is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand which will not be normalised for by the eu s official statistics office eurostat meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in two thousand twenty across the eu. vi spanish prices stay bearish but premium to france to persist spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown period which was recently extended until twenty six april with further extensions possible. nevertheless forecasts for below average wind generation would support spanish spot prices allowing france to continue exporting power to spain. this in turn should keep spanish near curve contracts at a premium to their french equivalents. vii coronavirus hits truck loaded lng demand market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced demand for truck loaded lng around europe as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel. data from terminals in northwest europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought. viii europe has found a coronavirus electricity demand floor electricity consumption has leveled out in germany france and italy after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. but in great britain and spain demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperature across europe s five largest consumers of electricity. ix european power and carbon markets affected by covid nineteen an early impact assessment in order to assess the fundamental impact of covid nineteen on european power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions. x india defers on lng cargoes as lockdown ramps up india buyers are deferring lng cargoes as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. this is a concern for sellers in a long market with india one of the key buyers. xi eu to reach two thousand twenty renewables goals on coronavirus brexit the combination of brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the eu as a whole as well as many member states to reach their two thousand twenty renewable targets according to icis model run. xii european power markets yet to hit coronavirus demand floor european power demand will continue to drop as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus. electricity consumption in italy and france fell sixteen percent below expectations over the past seven days according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperatures. three other major power markets studied by icis germany spain and the uk have seen smaller drops although all are trending down. xiii virus demand hit to wipe nine percent off two thousand twenty european power prices power demand drop likely icis model indicates six percent drop in demand during two thousand twenty price fall of nine percent across europe a scenario where power demand drops one tenth through up to june as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices across european markets fall by an average nine percent in two thousand twenty. xiv weather driven nbp prompt upside possible in week thirteen temperatures across nw europe to tumble in week fourteen british local distribution zone demand to increase eax nbp premium gaining incoming cooler weather across britain for week fourteen could encourage buying across nbp prompt and near curve contracts in the coming sessions. the drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus. xv southeast europe braced for falling demand bankruptcies eastern european and turkish energy companies are braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak. although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in italy or spain the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile. xvi europe on course for sharp reduction to power demand power sector demand across key european countries is set for a major slump over the coming weeks as countries scale up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus. demand in italy which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak has dropped ten percent compared to its five year average for march during the second week of its nationwide lockdown. as measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other european countries a similar drop in demand can be expected although changes are unlikely to be uniform. xvii china s city gas demand steady despite coronavirus uncertain elsewhere the impact of the coronavirus in china has reduced but gas demand will still end march well down from 20nineteen. city gate gas demand has been firm but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern. xix european gas centres set for april demand destruction eu wide demand crunch could follow after lockdowns intensify residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures lng sellers could struggle to deliver into europe xx coronavirus effects to ripple in mexico mexico s economy has perhaps never been more exposed to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. these will not help his party s two thousand twenty one election prospects if the country s economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight. xxi china s gas demand rebounds satellite data emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in china. this is an indication that economic activity is rising as businesses and industry ramp up activity with the coronavirus impact subsiding. xxii spanish virus to impact lng imports spain is home to one third of europe s lng import capacity so a lockdown has the potential to further gum up the global lng supply chain if as seems likely it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports. xxiii european nuclear plant operators gear up to ensure power supply european nuclear power availability is expected to remain robust with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak. xxiv bulgarian power traders call for nuclear maintenance change bulgaria s free energy market association asep has called for measures to tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on sixteen march. xxv global market moves feed energy downside jitters heightened concerns surrounding the economic fall out from the coronavirus is set to further weigh on european energy markets traders say. xxvi coronavirus likely to lower trader appetite for risk widespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set to hit european natural gas and power liquidity according to traders. a number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so. while some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor most other tasks can be done from home. however traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment. xxvii italian gas demand plunges on coronavirus restrictions the coronavirus outbreak took a toll on italian gas demand in week eleven as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus. if restrictions continue demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring pressuring consumption for heating. power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. gas is italy s main source for power generation and the marginal fuel therefore a price maker for italian power. xxviii expect weakness in chinese summer gas demand coronavirus impact on lpg to worsen china s big three will have sought some lng volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply incremental demand for gas and lng this summer will be unusually low xxix coronavirus fails to pull down

94,131,from alibaba to ping an and google to ford companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid nineteen. such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return. china which felt the primary impact of the pandemic was an early mover during this space. as home to a number of the world s largest firms it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift. working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid nineteen crisis as companies told their employees to remain home. around two hundred million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday. while this arrangement has some benefits like avoiding long commutes many employees and firms found it challenging. one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from nine hundred ninety six to seven meaning from nine to nine six days every week to all or any the time. on the private front employees found it difficult to manage kids home schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues. at an organization level many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly. if done right remote working can boost productivity and morale done badly it can breed inefficiency damage work relationships and demotivate employees. these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid nineteen on the world of work teams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity. being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them resulting in hold ups and delays. that s why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital. here smaller cross functional teams are helpful each with a transparent mission and reporting line where directions and tasks are easy to implement. this also simplifies onboarding new hires who can integrate faster in a very tight knit group at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isn t visible or easy to feel. with fewer in each team there s longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office. at ping an insurance workers are typically grouped in project teams of at most thirty members while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile. strong company wide foundations underpin this like having a typical purpose and unified goals. providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress. to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross functional squads to support its front line. it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely. the lesson putting in small cross functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course. managing people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home working environment. leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively. offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization. it s essential to foster an outcome driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open honest and productive communication. empowering your team in this way pays dividends.wesure a part of leading internet company tencent assembled a covid nineteen response team5 at the beginning of the year to supply amount freed from charge to front line medical workers. alan lau ceo of wesure credited his team saying that they had worked nonstop many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break demonstrating how responsive they were to the vision. for managers the challenge is to guide inspire and direct their team in their daily course of labor while being physically remote. upping the amount of interaction can even work well here. one chief information officer responding to a mckinsey survey said he s texting the whole company with regular updates because it s a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels. when working within distributed teams e commerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its one to one communications with employees to a weekly basis and in some teams members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues complete with plans for the week ahead. alibaba s productivity app dingtalk ding ding has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voice to text messages to their teams and to test in on progress. the lesson determining how you communicate is simply as important as what s being said and it has to be done confidently consistently and reliably as companies transition to the new normal it s important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception including caring for his or her children when schools are shut resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity. business leaders must respect and address these additional needs. empathy may be a crucial tool here offering how to attach promote inclusiveness and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction. increasing social interactions within the team particularly through one on one catch up guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts. by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues being inclusive in deciding and offering perspective in challenging moments managers can stay closer to what s occurring surface issues and help their teams solve problems effectively. a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently. as an example one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small business customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis. to try and do so effectively at scale the managers are supported through dedicated product programs online articles scripts for communicating with clients and internal training. inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy. creating outlets for sharing best practices success stories challenges and water cooler chat are significant to making a person s connection. giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors providing a transparent span of control and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation. the lesson connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotely. moving to remote working risks disrupting the office based flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules. spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how you ll work together. cover the daily rhythm individual constraints and specific norms you ll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way you ll mitigate it. how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this. the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetings. one leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams with a daily and weekly ritual of check ins sprint planning and review sessions. as alibaba embraced remote working it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run. one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes. team members can rate a meeting s usefulness by employing a five star system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward. to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools roles and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages. reiteration of decision making structures like this isn t always necessary when people can communicate directly but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in. the lesson establishing robust working norms workflows and features of authority is critical but only too easy to stint on. the final lesson being able to recognize what isn t working and changing it fast. these are the impacts of covid nineteen on the world of work. leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future. r d teams at one leading high tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it. within four weeks they had progressed from fifty percent to eighty eight percent of their baseline. as china s workforce begins to return to offices these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how with the correct structure culture processes and technology working remotely can boost productivity and morale. employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work life balance are likely to be happier more motivated and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations. embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term. alibaba launched taobao by now the world s biggest e commerce website while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the two hundred3 sars outbreak. for trip.com an overseas working experiment in twenty thousand one hundred forty seven established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture. hence bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your company suited the future whatever which will hold. these are policies that will mitigate the impacts of covid nineteen on the world of

95,132,when the british ruled india many indians accepted to work under their policy and they did not try to rebel against the british for their presence in indian lands they recognized the benefits of british rule. what was the factor that made indians accept the british government the perception about british policies about trading pay scale and positioning in the military had been done through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation and many were ready to accept the british. so the marketing is like fire when smartly handled it can destroy your enemies but when not it can burn you. marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product price place and promotion strategies. marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly boiling down to vital three. these are what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on based on gender age location customer class w1 what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer w2 what is your product promotion flow path w3 how much time it takes to convey product information to customer h1 . these criteria are what i call 3w1h forms. these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. however are they enough no. there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism fm . generally machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not the input is corrected to get the required output. when it comes to human beings he she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media tv advertising and so forth. slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer s mind. in the feedback mechanism the marketing team needs to answer only one question what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities if the product image not built as per expectation then management has to review and work on 3w1h as discussed earlier. so let s elaborate how 3w1h approach works along with feedback mechanism. after deciding the customer range you can work on other activities. since the customer is conscious about purchasing the product and when the product promoted the first thing the customer will check is its usefulness and if his her answer is yes then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the market. therefore one should present the product along with some unique thought and express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer mind. for example the polio campaign in india. the government had taken the initiative to make india polio free by spreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums in which television played a vital role. legendary cinema actor amitabh bachchan was selected as an ambassador for this campaign. initially the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating the children within a fixed schedule. the advertisement circulated throughout the nation and no stone was kept unturned by the government to make this campaign successful. however much to the surprise advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. this promotion failure was because of non consideration of the customer w1 and how advertise impacted its application on the customer w2 so after analysing failure experts recommended changes in their marketing campaign like to focus on major customer here mainly village woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv type of impact on people people who watched tv during that era had an image of amitabh as angry young man . so the campaign improved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead of his soft image which used in the earlier campaign. so in a very next polio campaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and when feedback is taken from people about such a sudden change they replied that we don t want to watch amitabh sir getting angry because of us. i in w3 organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer. currently there are a lot of platforms available by which you can market your product. the main agenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customer through marketing at very first if you make an impact on customer then only he can show interest in your product. for example changes in launching trailers of the upcoming films. till twentyth century television and newspaper were crucial factors but now along with television marketing team take help of internet resources like youtube facebook introducing an article on the pre trailer phenomenon. increasing the range of promotional devices broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box office. for the last factor h1 time the obvious question that comes to mind is that is time for advertising matters while watching the tv when an advertisement appears many times we change the channel instead of watching the whole ad or ignore it altogether. you do have an option of skip ad when you watch anything online so one must decide how much time is required to deliver product information during its promotion delivering product information in less time may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so it can result in attracting more customers. so the content will be the king in the marketing. however as one must have guessed it this will not work all the time. other factors like the cost of the product application range type of customer can also affect the h1. for example the customer would be more conscious while watching higher priced product broadcast compare to the lower priced one. so it would take more time for the marketing team to convince the customer to buy the expensive good than the lower priced one. after implementing a marketing strategy as per 3w1h we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information about product image generated in customer s minds through dealers and using feedback form. not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving product sales target and can make the situation even worse. take the example of the tata nano making of world s cheapest car which was mind blowing one of a kind projects in indian automobile industry. from the first phase of a marketing campaign tata nano was on so much continuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american president barack obama. ii the curiosity about the product was so high that the sale of then leading car model maruti eight hundred was dropped by twenty percent immediately after unveiling the nano. iii however while marketing the product an organization built affordable garibo ki car image in customer s mind which made customers conscious about what will be their status quo in society after buying nano thus they started giving preference to two wheelers over nano. during the same time some instances of nanos catching fire came into focus which worsened the situation. this case even exacerbates when the team did not work on the feedback mechanism and hence was not able to change customer perception about nano. later when nano fire problem was technically sorted out but even then the marketing team did not make any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car. therefore customer s negative perception remained stuck and the organization did not even come close to achieving selling figures of nano. if the organization had used feedback mechanism it would have been an entirely different story. so 3w1h can be an essential factor while developing a marketing strategy for the product along with a reversible fm method. this method can help us to monitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team to change strategy whenever it goes into the wrong path. i https www.thehindu.com news cities delhi when amitabhs voice did the trick to make india polio free article6257123.ece ii https www.businesstoday.in obamas india visit nano

96,133,the business of business is no longer to do just business or increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value. rather the concept of business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business the triple bottom line. people planet and profits are the core ideologies that are rooted in sustainable business. sustainability is taken into account when companies want to create long term value creation along with strategies that promote the longevity of the company. as corporate accountability rises expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders increases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be sustainable to stay alert and alive. business globalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some companies more powerful than some national governments making it easy for them to exploit inexpensive labor plunder natural resources causing severe impacts through pollution on the natural environment human health and biodiversity. unfortunately for them their horrible past has been catching up with them like in the case of child labor issues of ikea nike rana plaza accident in bangladesh affecting zara h m and other clothing brands environment pollution by bp shell exxon mobil etc. with the emergence of internet and social media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced the world has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every misdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. the media is fast picking up on cover ups half truths and bad corporate behavior and demanding accountability and transparency from corporates. therefore to survive companies are compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their suppliers as well. many of the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that last couple of decades were motivated solely by short termism the desire for instant gratification and the appeal of short term performance incentives. for instance deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to blame for the one thousand nine hundred eighty four leaks from the pesticide plant union carbide india ltd in bhopal. estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas discharge of the plant. finally union carbide corporation s one thousand nine hundred eighty nine litigation payout came out to today s equivalent of nearly one billion us dollars. another example where the company was forced to shut down operations was coca cola at its plachimada plant in kerala. the local communities faced acute water shortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities blatantly ignored the community woes. these businesses stated above didn t respect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise. today s issues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders and companies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. they need to engage with regulators communities societies suppliers and ngos for effective and desired outcomes. issues where engagement are required include population growth global middle class growth decline in ecosystems water scarcity food safety material resource security higher global energy demand changes in geographic patterns of energy consumption and increasing climate change regulatory interventions. by actively pursuing the triple bottom line the essential possibilities available are in order for companies to commit to sustainability they should have the below objectives in place sustainability triple bottom line can drive a company s achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building corporate shared value at its core and help in addressing social environmental problems. several investors today use esg metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company water use community development efforts and diversity board before investing. companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. research indicates that businesses with elevated esg scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. it s only a matter of time the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment people and its profits. blackcoffer insights twelve sanjana

99,136,why is there a severe immunological and inflammatory explosion in those affected by arms covid nineteen are these only genetic causes related to the immune response of ilsix and macrophages or would other types of scenarios be related to some environmental element il six is a marker for macrophages as an essential and pre inflammatory marker but my question is not directed at that already known factor but what i am asking is the reason for such a brutal response by the immune system. for example here in spain one of the parallel treatments is the administration of corticosteroids and anti inflammatory drugs. and another of the most worrying markers in patients is the increase in ferritin or that its values are out of range. the exacerbated response of the immune system specifically il six which in addition to being pre inflammatory also has an anti inflammatory function depending on which synergies occur with its two types of receptors. r il six and gp one hundred thirty this acts as an antagonist these types of proteins are very typical in endothelial cells or in macrophages. but my question is why this so severe call of il six and il one by those affected by covid nineteen. could it be that the virus s nexus protein had some synergy with r il six binding to it and in this case it was acting as an agonist and to act making a call effect. i don t know. my question is directed more at him why of that abrupt and exaggerated call. and in such a short time. could it have to do with the virus replication speed vs. slower activation speed of t and b lymphocytes in innate immunity monocytes in this case macrophages are cells that present il six in their cell membranes but such a large amount of response. it is as if the immune response is more associated with cellular damage damp . why even soluble peptides like cathelicidins hdps that react and are produced by cells of the epithelial tissue of the respiratory digestive system or the skin itself which are pro and anti inflammatory. and they also act as chemoattraction agents pro apoptosis in the case of epithelial cells and anti apoptotic in the case of neutrophils they are one more barrier of the innate immune system yes but to such an extent of producing that inflammation so severe and that cell death in such a short time,severe immunological inflammatory explosion affected arms covid genetic related immune response ilsix macrophages types scenarios related environmental element il macrophages essential pre inflammatory question directed factor reason brutal response immune system parallel treatments administration corticosteroids anti inflammatory drugs worrying markers patients increase ferritin values exacerbated response immune system specifically il addition pre inflammatory anti inflammatory function depending synergies occur types receptors il gp acts antagonist types proteins typical endothelial cells macrophages question severe il il affected covid virus nexus protein synergy il binding acting agonist act making effect question directed abrupt exaggerated time virus replication vs slower activation lymphocytes innate immunity monocytes macrophages cells present il cell membranes amount response immune response cellular damage damp soluble peptides cathelicidins hdps react produced cells epithelial tissue respiratory digestive system skin pro anti inflammatory act chemoattraction agents pro apoptosis epithelial cells anti apoptotic neutrophils innate immune system extent producing inflammation severe cell death time

101,138,since the creation of the eu we have been through many challenges worst than public health issues. human suffering and loss of life are always distressing but member states have done what they could to curb the spread of infection via the established partition of state boundaries as well as internally isolating critical cities and regions. to people living outside the eu it may seem strange and self serving when actually it is not as the eu is not a unified federal entity with one government legislation language and an army. we are however a christian alliance although we tolerate other religions too. as we are still in a process of achieving closer integration in some cases national law still supersedes supranational eu law. as each member state participates in the eu based first on the citizenship identity of its people it makes sense that a risk for public health involving contagion would have to be managed on a national basis. this approach also solves language barriers in hospitals and is more economical for each patient involved. by no means does it mean that cooperation between member states has stalled or ceased. our unity is not challenged. simply we are all in need of the same resources. there are not many companies in the eu that can produce extempore the necessary ppes. some restructuring of theirs and other companies modus operandi is needed but i have every confidence that we will adjust. shortages in the human sector i.e. medical personnel are more difficult to tackle.,creation eu challenges worst public health issues human suffering loss life distressing member states curb spread infection established partition boundaries internally isolating critical cities regions people living eu serving eu unified federal entity government legislation language army alliance tolerate religions process achieving closer integration cases national supersedes supranational eu member participates eu based citizenship identity people makes sense risk public health involving contagion managed national basis approach solves language barriers hospitals economical patient involved cooperation member states stalled ceased unity challenged simply resources companies eu produce extempore ppes restructuring companies modus operandi needed confidence adjust shortages human sector ie medical personnel difficult tackle

103,140,india is on the verge of an unprecedented economic as well as humanitarian disaster from covid nineteen. india is facing economic pressure due to the coronavirus outbreak. this outbreak has resulted in a steep slowdown in the indian economy whereby india s gdp has reduced by four.five percent as seen by current statistics. with covid nineteen being into the picture the indian economy is going through a severe slowdown and on top of that multiple such problems hitting the world of work from many such directions. companies and industries are finding it difficult to sustain in such an environment of the financial crisis. industries are being urged to take up certain tough decisions like layoff retrenchment compulsive leave without pay and many alternative cost effective methods to sustain the present economic crisis like cutting down the salaries handing over the pink slip to employees and opting best possible. the sudden outbreak has presented new roadblocks for the indian workforce and especially for the daily wage and contractual workers. according to the latest economy forecast by the un the probability of countries entering into the recession and companies going bankrupt has increased and india is not likely to remain decoupled from the global meltdown. lockdown across the country is causing significant disruption across multiple sectors including manufacturing tourism aviation real estate etc are the worst affected. temporary lockdown resulting in the closing of shopping malls has affected the indian economy in a disastrous manner adversely as a result of which consumption of essential items has reduced which in turn has given a terrible blow to the retail sector. according to the statistics from the economic times of india live event industries have seen an estimated loss of rupee three thousand crores. a number of young startups have been affected as the funding has fallen and there would be a lack of investors in the market. the disruption of the economy is much starker and alarming than the global financial crisis of two thousand eight which hit the indian financial sector. besides that back in two thousand eight the indian economy was much better placed to handle the crisis. according to the data in twonineteen the gst collection was expected to be approximately seven.four lakh crore while the government was only able to collect a total of five.eight lakh crore that is a total loss of one.six lakh crore the government also faced a setback in the income tax sector as the expected revenue to be collected was estimated to five.two lakh crore but the government faced a shortfall of five crores. the above discrepancies have resulted in insufficient funds with the government clearly the government does not have sufficient funds to provide relief to the people mainly the labor class contractual workers and the people working on the basis of daily wages. other major industries whose figures of losses are alarming are the hospitality and tourism industry which employs approx. four crore people. in the next one onetwo months it expects onetwo lakh job losses which may act as a major factor in revenue lo and revenue losses of rupee oneone crores. the aviation industry is worth rupee two.two lakh crore employing three.five lakh people they expect a revenue loss of rupee four two crores just between april and june. india s retail industry is the total worth of rupee five9 lakh crore employing around four.six crore people if the pandemic crisis lasts three months further it expects one.one crore job losses. the restaurant industry employs seventhree people of whom onefour percent onefive percent may probably lose their job. the real estate industry is looking at an approximate threefive percent four percent job loss. ride hailing industries meaning ola and uber have approximately five million driver partners the crisis has led to a drop of four percent five percent in the business. these figures would get even more disturbing in the next few weeks as the country heads into total lockdown. top car manufacturers like honda hyundai have shut down their car productions. many other such companies have shut down their production until further notice. this would again lead to more lay offs. the stock market in india has also seen a breakdown since the lockdown quarantine and lockdowns have disrupted the chain supply across the whole world. as the trade between the countries has come to a halt it has affected the global economy as well as the country s gdp. while some industries in india depend on other countries for their raw material for example the electronics market it depends on china majorly for its raw material has seen a major setback as trade between the two countries trade has been seized. the outbreak of the virus has placed tremendous responsibility in the hands of the government. the reserve bank of india rbi along with the government intends to implement below mentioned measures to deal with the looming economic crisis such as an economic response task force was announced on nineteen march twotwo led by the finance minister of india nirmala sitharaman to tackle the financial crisis. as of announced on march twosix a dollar twothree billion dollar package for fighting the economic pandemic has been sanctioned. the spending proposed in the package would amount to about .five percent of the estimated gdp while the other countries have a package of about four percent five percent of its gdp. everywhere in the world governments are recognizing that this is no time to worry about fiscal deficits. instead they have to do whatever it takes to come out of this extraordinary crisis. immediate and necessary actions are indispensable not only from the indian government but also from every individual to prevent this health pandemic from turning furthermore into an even greater economic disaster.,verge unprecedented economic

105,142,covid nineteen introduction the novel coronavirus covid nineteen initially emerged in china at the end of twonineteen and by the end of january two thousand twenty the world health organization declared this pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. this virus causes respiratory illness like the flu with symptoms such as a cough fever and in more severe cases difficulty in breathing or may cause lung disease. senior citizens or people under some medical treatment are more likely to acclimate to this virus. the impact of this outbreak is rapidly increasing at a higher rate than anything else in the economies of various countries of the world. this outbreak is considered a situation like recession or slowdown of the overall economy after the great recession in the year two thousand eight. india is the fifth largest economy in the world with a population of one hundred thirty three.ninety two crores. india is still in its developing phase and its uneven development across regions and communities adds various complexities in coping up with this kind of pandemic. it also reflects that there is a huge scope for social schism among the people of different communities. in india the first case was reported at the end of january month because people travel from china to india. the government of india made special arrangements for the students and people who were there in wuhan for studies and work so that india can save their people from the effect of this novel coronavirus. the infection rate of this virus is relatively low in india as compared to its population size because of the rapid actions taken by the government to quarantine people and shut borders. also the government of india announces the suspension of various activities in the country like shut down of educational institutes and corporate houses deferring all tourist visas and postal services cease all the interstate and intrastate borders within the country and terminate all the transportation facilities. the drive of social distancing and isolation of infected people also takes place. the initiatives taken by the government of india in accordance with this pandemic outbreak affect the economy in a very drastic way. it changes the way in which the country is developing. a lot of disruption is happening all around the nation which challenges the unimaginably ambitious aim of the modi government for achieving dollar five trillion economy by two thousand twenty four. covid nineteen economic impact the indian economy is deemed as the fastest developing economies in the world. india has now emerged as a global preeminent player in the world s economies and at the third largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. it consists of numerous sectors or channels such as hospitality education retail e commerce aviation petroleum banking automobiles pharma or healthcare insurance and railways etc. which are going unfavourably influenced by this disruption and through which the economy is getting affected. covid nineteen hospitality the hotel industry of india has a very vast contribution towards india s total gross domestic product. it is the most prominent service sector with market size of dollar twenty two billion in twonineteen the proposed rate of growth by eight.six percent till twotwofive now becomes a challenge because of this pandemic. the intact turnover of the indian hospitality sector was sunk between dollar eight.eightfive billion to dollar ten billion which reflects depletion of thirty nine percent fourfive percent as correlated to last year s revenues. the hospitality sector needs to take proactive financial steps to mitigate the impact of covid nineteen. it is wholly based on travel trade and tourism for its subsistence or existence. this extensive outbreak leads to huge cancellations of bookings in the last months leads to the miserable position of hotels in the worrisome declines. hotels are grappling from crisis amid stringent government restrictions and also emphasizing on isolation and social distancing. the impact is very huge and is unpredictable but the sector is at its maturity level and focusing on their hospitality commitment to and for the society in the best way they can. the big hotel chains in india propose their rooms and venues for free of cost or at very highly subsidized rates to the government for the purpose of quarantine people who came back from abroad and to the medical fraternity to use rooms as the isolation infirmaries. also the pantries are used for preparing feeds for the needy ones in a proper sanitized manner. the industry professionals have to keep an eye on their rivals to check their surviving policies at this consequence and they have to sustain their public image in the market after analysing the after effects on their pricing and preservation of their assets. this industry may exceed after witnessing remarkable assurance in the economy. covid nineteen education education is a pretty essential aspect in an underdeveloped country like india. india s education sector proposes a glorious opportunity to twenty nine percent of india s population which is between the ages of fourteen years. there is a foreseen rise in india s higher education sector of rs two forty four eighttwofour crore by twotwofive but as the occurrence of the virus that s a troublesome challenge. the covid nineteen outbreak has set off alarm bells across the country for the twofive million school going students along with students enrolled in universities in india. india s education sector is not unaffected it has given shut down of school colleges and other institutions this is basically for social distancing to prevent the cause effect of the spreading virus and be precaution beforehand of the disruption. india has resulted in forty nine.eightsix percent of the increase in internet penetration utilized to remit learning. so to permeate the pauses the virtual classes and online classes are catching the drift i.e. a merge turn to the digital learning platform. in the wake of this dilemma and gripping the student safety in mind and their scholarly concern most of the institutes have taken the action to accommodate the convenience of telecommunication skype call zoom call and admittance to other virtual prospects to fill the gap of learning. the examinations are being suspended or postponed keeping the concerns of the burgeoning covid nineteen on the masses extensively in the consultation. undoubtedly this is a very crucial time for students. ironically it has taken the covid nineteen outbreak to get the whole education sector to slip to digital mode and with both humanistic and technological support. the impact on education is likely to induce losses in terms of dropout rates and learning outcomes especially in regions with low shock resilience. covid nineteen travel tourism the coronavirus outbreak had a debilitating influence on india s travel and tourism sector with the industry assessing an overall deterioration of rupee five lakh crore with witnessing a four five crore people job cuts. it was also scrutinized that online travel agencies were set to suffer as much as rupee four three1two crores tour operators inbound and domestic rupee twofive crores adventure tour operators nearly rupee nineteen crores and cruise tourism rupee fournineteen crores. this sector engages employment to the extensive segment of the civilization like miniature homestays and regular wage earners. the time period from december to may is very crucial and important for this sector to attract its customers as people come from outside the country in this time span and also people within the country travel a lot to spend their summer holidays and also the people who travel abroad. according to icc foreign tourist arrivals fta has got fluff by about sixseven percent seasonally in january march while for domestic tourists the value is lower by almost four percent . according to the world economic forum wef this pandemic is putting up to five million jobs in the global travel and tourism sector at risk and out of this around three million would be in asia. indian chamber of commerce icc counsels fixing up of a travel tourism stabilisation fund with direct gain transfer to each unit to prevent commercial loss and sequential job loss. it is presumed that it would take up to ten months for the tourism sector to get back to its sustainable level. travel and tourism sector bodies had communicated to the government for interim aid to pay emis instalments taxes and salaries to operators as the tourism industry is eyeing destitution cessation of industries and mass lay off. the unskilled people of the industry are perceived as the most vulnerable link in the whole industry concatenation. covid nineteen banking financial the indian banking sector has an influential pivotal role in the development of an economy as it is considered a necessary service sector in society. india s banking sector is sufficiently capitalized and well regulated by the regulatory body the reserve bank of india rbi . currently indian banking and financial industry is at the fifth largest in the world and has the potential to become third largest by two thousand twenty four and contributing approx seven.seven percent towards the gdp of india. although the banking and financial sector were previously suffering a lot and are on the struggling plank because of scams like nirav modi vuca disruptions like demonetization the enlightenment of gst in the nation and now with this pandemic. this disruption causes so many problems to the retail as well as corporate customers. indian banking association said to bank customers that they should visit the bank branches only in the situation of extreme emergency. the bank branch cut offs the working hours in a day. many branches were sanitized under the orders of the state government and the services are kept limited which are most essential in the branches. rbi asked customers to use digital platforms for most of the operations and banks are operating round the clock to assure all digital channels are up to date. however an appropriate fiscal policy response should be implemented to uplift the economy from drowsiness to a vigorous state. from boosting bank s liquidity to providing financial relief to its customers rbi announced various guidelines to stabilize the concern of corporate houses as well as msmes and retail customers in the wake of this outbreak. banks are now being allowed for a three months moratorium on payment of instalments regarding all term loans prominent as on 1.three.two thousand twenty. also the repayment schedule and tenure of such loans can be shifted by three months. further to tackle financially this industry and its valuable customers the rbi also slashed the repo rate by sevenfive basis points. covid nineteen conclusion the government of india mobilized various committees or task force specifically for covid nineteen and national disaster management authority ndma to overcome from this pandemic. these committees are here to ensure a harmonized response against this outbreak. the government took all necessary steps to fight against the coronavirus such as introducing a new app for the population named as aarogya setu app which gives essential information about the virus. such crises also heal the earth back to its natural state with fewer disruptions by humans. it could also be stated that such crises also seed some opportunities in the nation for the better development of the whole economy.,covid introduction

106,143,what is coronavirus is it a disease how it is spread to humans how coronavirus affects the world economy several questions come in mind when we talk about the coronavirus. coronavirus disease covid nineteen is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. these are a type of virus that creates sickness in humans. there are many different kinds and some cause disease. a newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called covid nineteen. the covid nineteen virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. coronaviruses vary significantly in the risk factors. some can kill more than thirty percent of those infected and some are relatively harmless such as the common cold. coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms such as fever and a sore throat from swollen adenoids occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons. as it creates much chaos between humans and also affected the whole human diversity it also creates a disturbance in the economy. the economy is the largest system of trade and industry by which the wealth of a country is made and used. if this economy will not work then the human race will also come to an end. so not only covid nineteen makes the humans sick but also it makes the economy a viral whole. the impact of coronavirus firstly affects economic growth which is the factor that creates nation wealth. economic growth creates wealth on a national scale for the government in the form of taxation which is then redistributed accordingly to the services and communities that need it the most. due to covid nineteen industrial production sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year which decline the whole economic growth. such a slowdown in manufacturing industries has hurt countries that are interlinked to each other in terms of exports i.e. asia pacific economies sub saharan economies and the usa economies. a reduction in global economic activity has lowered the demand for oil taking oil prices to multi year lows. this happens even before a disagreement on production cuts between opec and its allies caused the plunge in oil prices. job creation and employment opportunities are the second most factor which was affected by coronavirus as it often requires the skills and some wilful hands which necessitate in the long term of the business. longer lasting and more intensive outbreak have half growth the opportunities in two thousand twenty as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to avoid the virus. poverty is the third and most important factor which is diversely affected by covid nineteen as employment is not there and everyone was ordered to stay at home. when people will be in their own houses then automatically poverty will increase complimenting the decrease in economic growth. there is also a big shift in stock markets

107,144,what is coronavirus is it a disease how it is spread to humans how coronavirus affects the world economy several questions come in mind when we talk about the coronavirus. coronavirus disease covid nineteen is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. these are a type of virus that creates sickness in humans. there are many different kinds and some cause disease. a newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called covid nineteen. the covid nineteen virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. coronaviruses vary significantly in the risk factors. some can kill more than thirty percent of those infected and some are relatively harmless such as the common cold. coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms such as fever and a sore throat from swollen adenoids occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons. as it creates much chaos between humans and also affected the whole human diversity it also creates a disturbance in the economy. the economy is the largest system of trade and industry by which the wealth of a country is made and used. if this economy will not work then the human race will also come to an end. so not only covid nineteen makes the humans sick but also it makes the economy a viral whole. the impact of coronavirus firstly affects economic growth which is the factor that creates nation wealth. economic growth creates wealth on a national scale for the government in the form of taxation which is then redistributed accordingly to the services and communities that need it the most. due to covid nineteen industrial production sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year which decline the whole economic growth. such a slowdown in manufacturing industries has hurt countries that are interlinked to each other in terms of exports i.e. asia pacific economies sub saharan economies and the usa economies. a reduction in global economic activity has lowered the demand for oil taking oil prices to multi year lows. this happens even before a disagreement on production cuts between opec and its allies caused the plunge in oil prices. job creation and employment opportunities are the second most factor which was affected by coronavirus as it often requires the skills and some wilful hands which necessitate in the long term of the business. longer lasting and more intensive outbreak have half growth the opportunities in two thousand twenty as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to avoid the virus. poverty is the third and most important factor which is diversely affected by covid nineteen as employment is not there and everyone was ordered to stay at home. when people will be in their own houses then automatically poverty will increase complimenting the decrease in economic growth. there is also a big shift in stock markets where shares in companies are bought and sold affected many investments by the investors and shareholders or individual savings accounts. central banks in many countries including india have slashed interest rates. supermarkets and online delivery services also have huge growth in demand as customers stockpile goods such as hand sanitizers toilet paper rice and orange juice etc.as the pandemic

108,145,blockchain or the distributed ledger technology has already been around for some time now. cryptocurrencies like bitcoin based on the blockchain technology are making entry into the formal finance world and increasingly becoming a medium for exchange. though there are many potential use cases for cryptocurrencies and the indian government is very critical about implementing the technology in banking and finance it still has a lot of issues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions. some of the most important drawbacks of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin right now are as below so it becomes important to have a cheaply available validation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connection in home small business computers. if two people have personal transaction history it s unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain every time a transaction takes place as it could bloat up the blockchain. moreover everyday transactions using cryptocurrency is not possible as the cost of posting a transaction for. let s say buying a coffee can be more than the price of coffee itself. lightning network is the latest disruptive technology being researched currently in fintech to make cryptocurrencies scalable. it basically adds an extra layer on top of the main bitcoin blockchain and enables payment channels between two parties over this layer. micropayments for everyday transactions can be very easily carried out using this channel. here is how it works suppose a buys a coffee from the nearby coffee shop b daily on her way to work. a and b decide to open a channel on the blockchain for their everyday transactions. once the channel or the lightning network is open the two parties can keep a track of their daily transactions on this ledger. at the end of the month with the ledger reflecting balances left with each party they decide to close the channel. this final transaction is then recorded on the main bitcoin blockchain. this reduces the cost of the transaction and enables micropayments for everyday transactions. micropayment channels can defer updating the main blockchain with remaining balances at a later date. a large network of micropayments can be created as a secondary layer on top of the main blockchain to address the scalability issue and reduce transaction fees. although this solution is very much in the initial stages resolving the scalability issue and reducing transaction fees by taking the transaction out of the main blockchain will give a big boost to the use of cryptocurrencies. the two parties exchange a single key for validation of their spend transactions. they can conduct an unlimited number of transactions on this channel and finally when one party closes the channel the balances will be added to the blockchain. the network is globally scalable since to reach any person through connected channels network you just need to know the path to connect to that person through leveraging your existing network. once the network develops in future the requirement to open a separate channel too would cease to exist since the algorithm will automatically find the shortest route to connect to the person whom you want to pay based on the exhaustive peer to peer network. this would ease inter country transactions and money can be sent across internationally within seconds. since the channel for lightning network is separate and not connected with the main blockchain it will not be backed by the security of the original blockchain. this can be a major concern for its widespread adoption and the companies should research extensively into this. another challenge is its dependency on the internet. the lightning network is not capable of storing coins digitally in a hardware wallet. this makes it prone to hackers since the wallet will be available online. also transferring large amounts of money is something that needs further detailed research since bigger payment might struggle with routing in the network. nevertheless this technology is really fascinating and has a very broad usage through the implementation of bitcoins and distributed ledger in everyday life. once this is rolled out for customer experience micropayments will be possible between two parties on blockchain just as we currently have wallets to transfer money for small purchases. the lightning network has a long way to go and is surely going to become the next big disruption in fintech domain after blockchain.,blockchain distributed ledger technology

109,146,reconciling with the financial realities of an mba education may come too late for many. there s a paper thin or let s say paper money thin difference between having a tight budget and being seriously stretched thin for money. dangerously enough during the second month of my mba i was treading on the prospect of the latter. it struck me that i could find my savior in an uncle who lived in san jose and was the type who always saved for a rainy day. with online payment avowedly ubiquitous and simple it seemed like a no brainer to me. one tap on an app and i would be rid of this predicament i had found myself in. quickly enough he initiated a fund transfer via xoom a paypal service. i was dismayed to learn it would take all of three days for the money to finally reach me one would believe that in the era of globalization and high speed internet payments would be fulfilled in a trice. but contrary to expectations i learned that most cross border payments are subject to numerous go betweens and channels rendering them behindhand especially in some parts of the word. a complex series of interactions involving banks merchants and other parties underlie the seemingly non complex act of initiating payment on the user friendly one quick interfaces. anyone who has transferred money between countries recently realizes the process has evolved little in decades. too slow untrustworthy and too expensive are the gripes. and as more of us become plugged into the globalized economy the scale of the problem is surely going to skyrocket. this begs the need for if a two1st century digital solution to cross border payments which could be faster less expensive more reliable and transparent. consider the case of ashok chandra a mid tier textile exporter. his business entails frequent wire transfers to dubai and indonesia. these wire transfers can take up to three days causing mr. chandra to worry about delays in addition to working capital constraints. he feels left in the dark regarding the standing of his dealing and out of pocket high fees such wire transfers are often a major deterrent to the volume of trade. small to medium sized enterprises above all suffer from payments difficulties. it may take weeks for a cross border payment to settle which may place the brakes on the business s liquidity and build friction between customers and suppliers. a mckinsey survey found that global payments looks set to be a dollar two trillion industry by two0two0 accounting for a third of banking revenues. nearly seventy percent of mid sized btwobs in the u.s. strongly preferred digital channels for payment approval and foreign exchange transactions emphasizing the dire need for efficient and real time payments. the payments industry is grappling for the backend to catch up with the apparent convenience which payments apps seek to provide. over the years the size of import and export trade between the u.s. and china has burgeoned to more than half a trillion dollars. presently payment suppliers have to pre fund accounts on either facet of dealing in native currencies. this may be costly and result in a poor deal for purchasers. benefitting from favorable exchange rates which come as an added advantage of faster payments is crucial as well. blockchain is touted as the solution for global business ills by its ardent supporters. the next big disruptive technology in the payment space blockchain can ease cross border payments in several ways. the distributed ledger technology dlt that underlies cryptocurrencies is currently being deployed by a few providers as the answer. roughly seventy percent of prime international banks are experimenting with it and recently some big implementations are underway the distinctive point of blockchain that reciprocally distrusting parties geographically agnostic will reach a sure agreement electronically is a banker s dream. for about the same transaction fee and a more competitive forex rate api based blockchain platforms can significantly cut down processing time. this can significantly cut down costs after nearly a century long stagnant processing fee of traditional banking. kuangyi wei head of research and market engagement at management consultancy parker fitzgerald estimates that it can save a third of the current operating costs. blockchain thus offers a cryptographically secure and trusty platform with high transparency. it further enables the bypassing of typical forex rates. small and mid size firms like that of mr.chandra s can thus reap the benefits of the best rates for their business. giants like ibm are working on designing a universal cross country blockchain payments solution that can herald instantaneously inter bank transfer. this would require streamlining multiple steps involving multiple stakeholders transacting in different currencies. distributed ledgers are changeless databases area unit maintained by a network of computers instead of a centralized authority and secured by advanced cryptography. these are often described and clunky and difficult to maintain. they require enormous computing power to reconcile everything. the matter is further aggravated by the volume of cross border payments banks and jurisdictions. centralized databases area unit still a lot of economical than blockchains. over sold and over hyped area unit different words utilized in this context managing expectations on what blockchain are able to do are vital. operational resilience has additionally become a significant issue for central banks and regulators. considerations raised regarding dlt embrace privacy security measurability and competition only time can tell if blockchain will eventually become the panacea of payments it is heralded to be.,reconciling financial realities mba education late paper thin paper thin difference tight budget stretched thin dangerously mba treading prospect find savior uncle lived type saved rainy online

111,148,quality and affordable healthcare is a vision of all governments across the globe. the high cost of medical service and lack of sufficient infrastructure is detrimental to this vision. in developed countries such as the u.s. reducing healthcare cost is an agenda point of all the politicians. even in india affordable healthcare will be as important as roti kapda and makan in the near future. technology can play a big role in reducing healthcare cost and making it more efficient. the vast quantity of data is available with hospitals and insurance providers. big data can play a big role in analyzing this data to produce actionable insight. some of the benefits of using big data are as follows fraud has a big impact on everyone. in fact the national healthcare anti fraud association estimates that fraud costs americans at least dollar thirty three billion to dollar fifty five billion annually that s approximately three five percent of the nation s health care spending of dollar two.two6 trillion. for example sometimes providers or hospitals report procedures or services that were never provided. big data analytics can help an insurance company to discover these frauds. big data can use a huge amount of historical data to identify expected procedure or service for reported illness identified using diagnosis code . if the expected procedure code doesn t match with a billed procedure code insurance companies can tag claim as a potential fraud claim. once a claim is tagged as a fraud claim the manual examiner needs to do additional verification to ensure that the claim is submitted by fraud provider. sometimes patients fake identity to get the benefit of insurance. using big data companies can match patients information with services he she has taken. if services taken by the patient is very different from the past medical history of patients analytics can tag claim as one of the susceptible fraud claims. traditional health care providers find it difficult to store a vast amount of data. more ever traditional database stores only structured data. big data can solve storage issue by handling huge volume and variety of data. having historical data of the patient can reduce healthcare drastically. it is very tough to get a physician s appointment in developed countries. one of my friends senior director in a multinational bank got an appointment for hip replacement surgery with a waiting period of six months. he was not able to sit and as a result he didn t drive or come to the office for six months. the waiting period can be drastically reduced if the hospital is able to forecast the number of patients likely to miss appointments. based on historical data hospitals can predict the number of no shows and can accordingly schedule appointments so as not to miss any slot because of no shows. if a health insurance company pays an amount to hospital provider that is greater than the contracted amount for service payment is called an overpayment. similarly if payment made is lesser than the contracted amount for service payment is called an underpayment. overpayment or underpayment is a big headache for both insurance companies and patients. according to aha data private insurance companies have consistently overpaid hospitals for inpatient care for more than three decades. these overpayments have varied significantly over the years but have grown dramatically in the past few years. overpayment or underpayment can happen because of multiple reasons such as system glitch a coding error. using cognitive analysis big data can predict the payment amount. if the predicted payment amount is significantly different than the actual payment amount the system can identify possible overpayments or underpayments. throughout the world healthcare is based on diagnosing the presence of disease and subsequently treating the disease if present. early diagnosis of the illness is a major challenge. patients do go for diagnosis only when the symptom is evident. it becomes challenging for the physician to treat illness once illness grows beyond a certain level. predictive or preventive can help to identify if an individual will develop a disease. different forms of health device such as iwatch can capture data and send to the hospital at regular interval of time. using predictive analysis the hospital can predict if a patient is likely to develop an illness. early diagnosis of illness can help doctors to treat patients effectively and at a lower cost. predictive treatment can reduce the number of days a patient needs to be admitted in the hospital. as inpatient treatment is costlier than outpatient treatment doctors can discharge patients if he she thinks that the condition of the patient is not serious. the hospital can monitor the patient remotely using medical sensors and can call the patient to the hospital when it is required. big data plays a big role when a person suffers from multiple illnesses. as per dr. abhishek rai m.s. ortho of k.e.m. medical college mumbai it becomes challenging to operate patients when he suffers from multiple illnesses. many a number of times physicians are not aware of all issues with patients as patients themselves are not aware of all illness . as an example it s tough to operate on a person suffering from diabetes as blood doesn t coat easily for a diabetic person. if a physician doesn t have historical data of a diabetic person he she may operate diabetic person wrongly. another example where big data analytics can play a huge role in predicting disease is a genetic disease. if a person has breast cancer her child is 1five two0 percent likely to develop breast cancer. using big data analytics the system can identify patients likely to suffer from genetic disease and request patients to do timely screening. genetic diseases can be screened in first second or third degree relatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality. in india it takes two three days on an average to get an mri scan. delay is not because of lack of medical instruments but because of lack of qualified radiologists. this problem can be mitigated by integrating medical imaging with big data. integration of medical imaging with big data will ensure that radiologists get the report in a short span of time. big data will help not only to reduce the turnaround time required to get reports but also to get better reports. technology can convert image to graphs and charts making it easier for radiologists to read the report. as data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity. so the more data we have the better the outcomes can be obtained. thus big data technology is clearly the digital disruptor to revolutionize the healthcare sector by consolidating the data from disparate platforms to build a three60 degree view about the human body and help the healthcare provider to generate solutions to life threatening problems and improved healthcare opportunities.,quality affordable healthcare vision governments globe cost medical service lack sufficient infrastructure detrimental vision developed countries us

from the data to generate value and enjoy operational financial and clinical insights. there are genome analyzers and other analytics tools in the market that help in understanding the facts and eliminate unwanted useless details to extract only what s needed. the end result of this is better clinical outcomes for the patient. there are several ways in which healthcare organizations can make use of information collected through various sources. the following examples indicate successful applications built on a foundation of advanced analytical capabilities in the healthcare industry predictive analytics is key to enabling hospitals to properly manage their readmission rates and sidestep costly penalties while simultaneously addressing important aspects of patient treatment and care. analytics are changing roles in the healthcare industry. an increasing number of informed patients are taking more responsibility for their own care. likewise physicians are finding more satisfaction with their positions as positive effects increase. more time spent with individual patients has increased which gives physicians the chance to form a trusted relationship with the patient. physicians want to spend time with their patients to know them interact with them and help them. when the time to develop a relationship is diminished the physician is less satisfied with his or her profession. analytics has changed the way the healthcare world operates. with the ability to transform the way medicine has been practiced for years analytics have resulted in improved health reduction in diseases and more satisfied patients and physicians. combine artificial intelligence with data analysis and machine learning iot and it is easy to provide proactive care to patients.

113,150,to begin with i shall first like to explain what big data is and why it has become so important in our lives. big data is simply data but with a huge size. data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time. such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools. so how huge can this data be social media sites like facebook generate more than five hundred terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos video uploads text messages etc. a single jet engine can generate more than ten terabytes of data in thirty minutes of flight time. with many thousand flights per day generation of data reaches up to many petabytes. data contained in these sets are not always structured. it can be semi structured or even unstructured. when such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it. therefore modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data sets. now coming to the opportunities that big data provides they are not just limited to healthcare. big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth. healthcare is no exception. big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people. healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system. it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care. however when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially. in india many times we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients. for instance when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate we can easily gauge our helplessness. however the scenario is certainly improving now. with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data. this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively. the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring. this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare. this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer. healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situations. apart from reduced er visits and timely treatment there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis. patients with high risk life threatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities. due to lack of data there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals. under or over booking of staff lack of medical equipment medicines and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and ill management of finances. using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances. better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations. by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well. when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones it may lead to incorrect decisions. this is known as recency bias. big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies. while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data. there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation. one of the biggest challenges is security. healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients. acts of hacking cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases. such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money. protection of the patients privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation. also the data would contain external data apart from medical information. the organization therefore has to take care of privacy legal compliances and government policies. privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permitted. the next challenge is data classification and modeling. the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous. classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge. modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult. storage and retrieval is another major challenge. huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data. also the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hassle free. the way storage is a challenge retrieval also is a matter of concern. integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job. the next challenge is a major one in my opinion. finding the right talent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduous task. shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today. even after hiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them. scarce resources like data scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain. they are easily poached by competitors. a good and efficient compensation strategy conducive work environment high incentives opportunities for career growth and development can be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent. in a nutshell we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibility.,begin explain big data important lives big data simply
